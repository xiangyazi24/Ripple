# Frobenius framework — Step 1: formal Euler-operator substitution

This file starts the general Frobenius / regular-singular-point
infrastructure described in `STRATEGY.md`. We formalise the Euler
operator `L = t · d/dt` acting on formal power series and the shifted
operator `ρ + L` that appears when substituting the Frobenius ansatz
`y(t) = t^ρ · g(t)` into a linear ODE rewritten in Euler form:
`(Σ_j a_j(t) · L^j) y = 0`.

The main result, `coeff_zero_indicialSum`, states that the constant
coefficient of `Σ_j a_j(0) · (ρ + L)^j g` equals `P(ρ) · g(0)`, where
`P(ρ) = Σ_j a_j(0) · ρ^j` is the indicial polynomial. This is the
algebraic kernel of the leading-coefficient identity for the Frobenius
substitution.

The concrete Apéry indicial polynomial (`aperyConifoldIndicial` in
`Ripple/Number/AperyConifoldIndicial.lean`) is an instance of this
general construction; the generalisation will be threaded through once
the remaining Frobenius steps (`Substitution.lean`, `LocalSolution.lean`)
are in place.

then view `P(ρ) = Σ_j a_j(0) · ρ^j` as a polynomial in `ρ`.

The input `as : ℕ → ℝ` supplies the values `a_j(0)` and is ignored for
`j > k`. In the typical regular-singular-point setup one has `a_k(0) = 1`
(leading term normalised), but that is not required here. -/

/-- **Leading-coefficient identity.** For the Frobenius ansatz
`y = t^ρ · g` and the Euler-form ODE `Σ_j a_j(t) L^j y = 0`, the constant
coefficient (coefficient of `t^0`) of the Frobenius-substituted operator
`Σ_j a_j(0) · (ρ + L)^j g` factors as `P(ρ) · g(0)`, where `P` is the
indicial polynomial.

This is the algebraic content of Step 1 of the Frobenius framework:
demanding vanishing at leading order and `g(0) ≠ 0` forces `P(ρ) = 0`,
i.e. `ρ` is an indicial root. -/
