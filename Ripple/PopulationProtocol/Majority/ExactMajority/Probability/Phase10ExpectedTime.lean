# Phase-10 Backup Expected Stabilization Time (Doty et al. Lemma 7.7)

The 6-state Phase-10 backup protocol stably computes majority in `O(n log n)`
*parallel* time, both in expectation and with high probability.  This file
formalizes the **expectation** bound.

## Convention (READ THIS)

All time bounds in this file are stated in **interaction counts** (= kernel
steps), NOT parallel time.  Parallel time = interactions / n, so the paper's
`O(n log n)` parallel-time statements become:

  * cancel stage (active B against active A):   `O(n²)` interactions;
  * coupon-collector stages (absorb T, convert passive):  `O(n² log n)` each.

The expected hitting time is the E1 tail-sum `expectedHitting K c Done`
(`= ∑' t, (K^t) c Doneᶜ`), which under the standard identity
`E[T] = ∑_{t≥0} P(T > t)` equals the mean number of interactions to reach the
stable set `Done`.

## Structure (three sequential coupon/cancel stages, majority case WLOG A)

1. All active-B agents cancel against active-A agents (`Phase10Transition`
   cancel reaction): with `b` active-B and `a ≥ b` active-A agents, the per-step
   cancel probability is `≥ a·b / (n·(n−1)) ≥ b / (n·(n−1))`, and the potential
   `b = activeBCount` strictly drops on each cancel.  Harmonic-free here: a crude
   `∑_{b ≤ n} (n·(n−1))/b ≤ (n·(n−1))·(H_n)` interaction bound, dominated by the
   coupon stages.
2. The active-A agents absorb all active-T agents (broadcast A): coupon-collector
   on `wrongACount`, per-step success `≥ wrongACount / (n·(n−1))`, expected
   `≤ (n·(n−1))·H_n = O(n² log n)` interactions.
3. Same shape converting passive agents.

The **generic engine** (`Coupon` section below) is the level-split coupon
bound: a `ℕ`-valued potential `Φ` non-increasing along the kernel, with a
per-level one-step strict-decrease probability `≥ p_lev`, yields
`E[T] ≤ ∑_{m < Φ c₀} (p_lev m)⁻¹` interactions.  This is the harmonic / coupon
sum.  It is built directly on E1's `expectedHitting` toolkit
(`ExpectedHitting.lean`) and the per-step progress technique of
`Phase2TimeConvergence.step_advance_prob` (one useful ordered state pair fires
with probability `interactionCount / totalPairs`).

## Status

The generic coupon engine and the per-stage potential bookkeeping are delivered
and axiom-clean.  The capstone instantiation for the real
`(NonuniformMajority L K).transitionKernel` requires the per-step progress lower
bound to be discharged against the *state-multiplicity* of `AgentState`: an
"active A" is not a single scheduler state `Λ` but a whole class of `AgentState`
records, so the single-useful-pair bound of `step_advance_prob` must be replaced
by a class-aggregated `interactionCount` lower bound.  That bridge is documented
as the remaining blocker at the end of this file (see `phase10_progress_blocker`).

We work over a generic measurable space `α` and a Markov kernel `K`, exactly as
in `ExpectedHitting.lean`, with a `ℕ`-valued potential `Φ`.  `Done = {Φ = 0}`.

The campaign's "chaining lemma": for nested absorbing sets `Done ⊆ Mid` the
expected hitting time of `Done` splits additively into the time to reach `Mid`
plus the residual time spent in `Mid ∖ Done`.  This is the kernel-power form
`(K^t) c Doneᶜ ≤ (K^t) c Midᶜ + (K^t) c (Mid ∩ Doneᶜ)`, summed over `t`.  It lets
a multi-stage potential descent (cancel → absorb-T → convert-passive) be bounded
stage by stage. -/

/-! ### Level occupation from a constrained start (coupon-collector core)

The single rigorous waiting-time fact behind the coupon sum: if the potential
never increases along `K` and from every state at level exactly `m` (`Φ = m`,
`m ≥ 1`) the one-step probability of dropping to `Φ < m` is at least `1 - q`
(`q < 1`), then starting **at or below level `m`** the expected time to hit
`{Φ < m}` is `≤ (1 - q)⁻¹`.

The trick: starting at `Φ ≤ m`, the chain stays in `{Φ ≤ m}` (`Φ` non-increasing),
so the "not yet below `m`" event coincides with the level-`m` event, on which the
per-step drop hypothesis applies uniformly.  We instantiate E1's
`expectedHitting_one_step_q` with `Done := {Φ < m}` after transporting the start
into `{Φ ≤ m}`. -/

/-! ### Full coupon assembly (harmonic sum)

Chaining the per-level occupation bound down the potential ladder gives the total
expected hitting time of `Done = {Φ = 0}` as the sum of the per-level waiting
times `∑_{m=1}^{M} (1 - q_m)⁻¹`.  This is the harmonic / coupon sum: for the
Phase-10 coupon stages `q_m = 1 - m/(n(n−1))`, so `(1-q_m)⁻¹ = n(n−1)/m` and the
sum is `n(n−1)·H_M = O(n² log n)` interactions.

The chaining is downward induction on the level gap, peeling one level per step
via `expectedHitting_le_through_mid`: hitting `{Φ < m}` from a start at level
`≤ M` costs the level-`M` waiting time plus hitting `{Φ < m}` from the next level
down.  We package the per-level drop hypotheses as a single family `q : ℕ → ℝ≥0∞`
with `hdrop : ∀ m b, Φ b = m → K b (potBelow Φ m)ᶜ ≤ q m`. -/

This is the exact occupation decomposition (`{Φ ≥ 1} = ⨆ₘ {Φ = m+1}` disjointly),
the bookkeeping skeleton of the coupon sum.  Bounding each `occLevel K Φ m c` by
the per-level waiting time `(1 - q m)⁻¹` (the strong-Markov restart, see
`occLevel_le_blocker`) then yields the harmonic bound. -/

/-! ### Arbitrary-start level occupation (the strong-Markov restart, formalized)

We now discharge the per-level occupation bound

  `occLevel K Φ m c ≤ (1 - q m)⁻¹`   for **arbitrary** start `c`  (∗)

required by `coupon_expectedHitting_le_of_occBounds`.

The constrained case `Φ c ≤ m` is immediate from `level_occ_geometric`
(`{Φ = m} ⊆ (potBelow Φ m)ᶜ`, geometric decay, geometric series).  The arbitrary
case is the **first-passage restart**: from a start `Φ c > m` the time-0 level-`m`
mass is `0`, and one Chapman-Kolmogorov step pushes the whole occupation onto the
one-step successors, where the bound holds by induction.  We avoid a pathwise
strong-Markov statement by inducting on a **time-truncated** occupation
`∑_{i<t} (K^i) c {Φ = m}` (a uniform-in-`c` bound for every truncation `t`), then
passing to the `tsum` limit.  No measure-theoretic first-passage σ-algebra is
needed — only the kernel Chapman-Kolmogorov identity and a Markov-kernel
`∫ const = const`. -/

/-! ### Harmonic / coupon-sum evaluation (generic bookkeeping)

The capstone RHS is the coupon sum `∑_{m=1}^{M} (1 - q m)⁻¹`.  For the Phase-10
shape `(1 - q m)⁻¹ = n(n-1)/m`, the exact value is `n(n-1)·H_M`, but the engine
only needs an upper bound.  We record the crude per-level-uniform bound: if every
active level's waiting time is `≤ r`, the sum is `≤ M·r` (here `r = n(n-1)` since
`n(n-1)/m ≤ n(n-1)` for `m ≥ 1`), which already gives the `O(n²·M)` interaction
count; for the coupon stages `M = O(n)`, i.e. `O(n³)`, dominated by — and in the
paper sharpened to — the `n(n-1)·H_n = O(n² log n)` harmonic form.  The crude
bound is what the chained stage argument consumes; recorded here so the harmonic
constant is not on the critical path. -/

/-- **Crude coupon-sum bound.** If every active-level waiting time `(1 - q m)⁻¹`
(`1 ≤ m ≤ M`) is bounded by a common `r`, then the coupon sum is `≤ M · r`.  Feeds
the capstone RHS with `r = (per-level waiting-time ceiling) = n(n-1)`. -/

/-! ## Invariant-relative coupon engine (Brick B1 generic infrastructure)

The Phase-10 stage potentials (`activeBCount`, `wrongACount`) are **not**
non-increasing on the full `NonuniformMajority` kernel: a pre-phase-10 reaction
(`enterPhase10`, epidemic entry) can create active-B agents or un-A an A.  The
per-pair non-increase holds only when both interacting agents are already in phase
10, i.e. on the **all-phase-10 subdynamics**.

We thread an abstract invariant `Inv : α → Prop` through the engine.  Two abstract
hypotheses suffice and are both discharged for `Inv = Phase10EpidemicPost` by the
existing support-closure machinery:

* **`InvClosed K Inv`** — `Inv` is `K`-support-closed: from an `Inv`-state, one step
  almost surely stays in `Inv` (`K b {¬ Inv} = 0`).  (For the protocol kernel this
  is `Phase10EpidemicPost` preservation: phases only increase and 10 is the max.)
* **`PotNonincrOn Inv K Φ`** — `Φ` is non-increasing from every `Inv`-state:
  `K b {Φ b < Φ x} = 0` for all `b` with `Inv b`.  (The per-pair bound on the
  phase-10-restricted transition.)

Carrying `Inv` a.e. along the kernel powers (every reachable state from an
`Inv`-start satisfies `Inv`), the level-occupation contraction goes through with the
drop hypothesis only required at `Inv`-states.  All engine theorems below mirror
their unconditional counterparts; the proofs differ only by intersecting the
relevant null sets with `{¬ Inv}` (which is itself null). -/

`¬ Inv` is `0`. -/

/-! ### Phase-10 instantiation target

For the real protocol `K := (NonuniformMajority L K).transitionKernel` and the
stage potentials of `Analysis/Phase10Backup.lean`:

* **cancel stage** `Φ := activeBCount` (majority A case): `Done = {activeBCount = 0}`;
* **absorb-T stage** `Φ := wrongACount` after `activeBCount = 0`;
* **convert-passive stage** `Φ := wrongACount` (passive recount).

**Generic engine: fully closed (E2-6/7/8).**  `coupon_expectedHitting_le_uniform`
takes exactly `(PotNonincr K Φ)`, `(hdrop : ∀ m b, Φ b = m → K b (potBelow Φ m)ᶜ ≤
q m)`, `(Φ c ≤ M)`, and a uniform per-level ceiling `r` (`(1 - q m)⁻¹ ≤ r`), and
returns `expectedHitting K c (potBelow Φ 1) ≤ M·r` — no residual hypotheses.  Only
the THREE protocol facts below remain, all in `Analysis/Phase10Backup.lean` land:

1. `PotNonincr K Φ`, i.e. `∀ c, K c {c' | Φ c < Φ c'} = 0`.  Via the established
   support template (`Phase0Convergence.phaseBelowCount_step_le` / `mcrCount_step_le`):
   `c' ∈ (stepDistOrSelf c).support` ⇒ `Protocol.stepDist_support` peels a pair
   `(r₁,r₂)`, `Φ c' = Φ(c-{r₁,r₂}) + Φ{Transition r₁ r₂}` (countP additivity,
   `Multiset.countP_add`), so it reduces to the **per-pair bound**
   `Φ{Transition r₁ r₂} ≤ Φ{r₁,r₂}` (a `Transition_activeBCount_le` /
   `Transition_wrongACount_le`, the analogue of `Transition_phaseBelowCount_le`).
   **SCOPING CAVEAT (precise):** this per-pair bound is FALSE for the *full*
   `NonuniformMajority` kernel — pre-phase-10 reactions (`enterPhase10`, epidemic
   entry) DO create active-B / un-A an A.  So `PotNonincr` holds only on the
   **phase-10-restricted** subdynamics.  The honest discharge is either (a) run the
   stages on the absorbed/restricted kernel where every reachable config satisfies
   the all-phase-10 invariant (`backupSignal_of_all_phase10` regime), proving the
   per-pair bound under `IsActiveX`-typed hypotheses on `r₁,r₂`; or (b) thread an
   all-phase-10 invariant `J` through a `PotNonincr`-relative-to-`J` variant of the
   engine.  This invariant-threading is the first genuine instantiation brick.
2. the per-level drop `K c (potBelow Φ m)ᶜ ≤ q m` with `q m = 1 - m/(n(n−1))`.  The
   useful-interaction probability is `≥ (class interactionCount)/(n(n−1))`; with `m`
   active-B and `≥ 1` active-A (from `exists_activeA_of_phase10ActiveSignedSum_pos`
   in the majority-A case), the class count is `≥ m`.  **State-multiplicity subtlety
   (precise):** `step_advance_prob` is proven over `Bool` for a single fixed pair
   `(true,false)`; here "active A" / "active B" are *classes* of `AgentState`
   records, so the single-pair mass bound must be aggregated over the
   active-A × active-B class.  This needs (i) the real-kernel analogue of
   `step_advance_prob` (the `interactionPMF (r₁,r₂)` mass lower bound for an
   applicable `AgentState` pair, following the `stepDist = map scheduledStep
   interactionPMF` route used in `ClockOLogN`/`ClockFaithful`), and (ii) summing
   that mass over the `Finset` of present useful pairs via `interactionPMF`/`countP`
   additivity to reach `≥ m/(n(n−1))`.  This is the second (largest) brick.
3. the harmonic evaluation — DONE generically: `coupon_sum_le_of_uniform` gives the
   crude `M·r = O(n³)`; the sharp `n(n−1)·H_n = O(n² log n)` is a constant
   refinement of the same Icc sum (`∑ 1/m`), orthogonal to the engine.

The three stages are then chained by `expectedHitting_le_through_mid`
(majority/tie case split via `Phase10Backup.backupSignal` sign), giving the
Lemma 7.7 expectation bound in interaction counts.  Remaining work = bricks 1 and 2
above (invariant-threading + class-aggregated probability), both PURELY protocol
instantiation; the probability/coupon engine carries no further obligation. -/

end Coupon

/-! ## Phase-10 per-level drop probability (Brick B2)

We instantiate the per-level drop hypothesis of the invariant-relative engine for
the real kernel `K = (NonuniformMajority L K).transitionKernel` and `Φ =
activeBCount` on the all-phase-10 invariant `Inv = Phase10EpidemicPost`.

The route is the one used by `Invariants.phase10_descent_prob`: the public helper
`Phase0Convergence.stepDistOrSelf_toMeasure_ge` reduces a kernel-mass lower bound on
a target set to the `interactionPMF` mass of a `good` Finset of ordered pairs that
land in the target.  Each ordered pair `(a, b)` with `a` active-A and `b` active-B
fires the Phase-10 cancel reaction, which strictly lowers `activeBCount` (so it
lands in the drop target).  Aggregating over the `m` distinct active-B agents
(paired with one fixed active-A) gives mass `≥ m / (n(n−1))`. -/

The same machinery applies to the absorb-T / convert-passive coupon stages with
`Φ = wrongACount` (agents whose output is not `A`).  An active-A meeting any
non-active-B agent whose output is not `A` converts it to `A`, dropping
`wrongACount`.  In the post-cancel regime (`activeBCount = 0`) every wrong agent is
automatically non-active-B, so the useful class is active-A × {output ≠ A}. -/

For the three-stage invariant chain we need, on a both-phase-10 interacting pair,
that each stage potential never strictly increases.  We prove the per-pair
`countP`-bound directly by exhaustive case analysis on the two outputs and the two
`full` flags (the same brute-force pattern as the public `Phase10Transition_*`
output lemmas), then lift to the kernel via the support template
(`phaseBelowCount_step_le`-style: peel a pair, `countP` additivity, restore). -/

/-! ## Kernel-level lifting: `InvClosed` and `PotNonincrOn`

We lift the per-pair `countP`-bounds to the real kernel via the support template
(peel a pair from `stepDistOrSelf`'s support, `countP` additivity, restore), with
the interacting pair members inheriting the all-phase-10 / typed restrictions from
the invariant on the whole configuration.

The three stage invariants:
* `Inv₁ := AllPhase10` (`= Phase10EpidemicPost`);
* `Inv₂ := AllPhase10 ∧ activeBCount = 0`;
* `Inv₃ := AllPhase10 ∧ activeBCount = 0 ∧ activeTCount = 0`. -/

/-! ## Majority-case stage invariants (carry `card = n` and a positive signed sum)

The drop-probability lemmas require `2 ≤ card` and `1 ≤ activeACount`.  We thread
these as part of the invariant: in the majority-`A` case the active signed sum
`phase10ActiveSignedSum = activeACount − activeBCount` is a fixed positive integer
`g > 0`, conserved by the kernel; with `card = n` fixed too, `1 ≤ activeACount`
follows (`activeACount = activeBCount + g ≥ g ≥ 1`). -/

/-! ### Harmonic refinement of the `qLevel` coupon sum

The crude uniform ceiling `(1 − qLevel n m)⁻¹ ≤ n(n−1)` summed over `m ∈ [1,M]`
gives `M·n(n−1)` (`= O(n³)` for `M = O(n)`).  The paper-faithful bound replaces
the per-level constant by the *exact* per-level waiting time `(1 − qLevel n m)⁻¹ =
n(n−1)/m` and sums the harmonic series:

  * **linear-rate stages** (coupon: absorb-T, convert-passive, T-spread) keep
    `qLevel n m = 1 − m/P`, so `∑_{m=1}^{M} P/m = P·H_M ≤ P·(1 + log M)`,
    giving `O(n² log n)` interactions;
  * **quadratic-rate stages** (cancel: `m` active-B against `≥ m` active-A) use
    the refined `qLevelSq n m = 1 − m²/P`, so `∑_{m=1}^{M} P/m² ≤ 2P`, giving
    `O(n²)` interactions.

facts; no protocol content. -/

/-! ### Full three-stage chaining (S1 start)

The stabilization time from an `S1` start decomposes additively through the two
intermediate done-sets `Done₁ = {activeBCount = 0}` and (within it)
`Done₂' = Done₁ ∩ {activeTCount = 0}`.  `expectedHitting_le_through_mid` applied
through `Done₁` gives the machine-checked decomposition

  `E[hit Done₃] ≤ E[hit Done₁] + ∑ₜ P(Done₁ ∖ Done₃ at t)`,

with `E[hit Done₁]` discharged by `stage1_expectedHitting_le`.  The residual
cross-term `∑ₜ (K^t) c (Done₁ ∩ Done₃ᶜ)` is the occupation of
`{activeBCount = 0, wrongACount > 0}`; bounding it by the stage-2 + stage-3 coupon
sums is the one remaining obligation (see the closing campaign note: it needs a
`PotNonincrOn`-occupation bound for `activeTCount`/`wrongACount` transported from
the `S1` start, using that `{activeBCount = 0}` is **absorbing** under `S1` so the
run satisfies `S2`/`S3` from its first visit onward — a strong-Markov restart
extension of the `occLevel_le_on` engine). -/

/-- **Three-stage chaining decomposition (machine-checked).** From an `S1` start,
the expected hitting time of the stabilized set `Done₃ = {wrongACount = 0}` splits
as the stage-1 (cancel) time to `Done₁ = {activeBCount = 0}` plus the occupation of
the residual region `{activeBCount = 0, wrongACount > 0}`.  The stage-1 term is
fully bounded; the cross-term is the residual occupation. -/

/-! ### Closing the chain: the two cross-terms

The remaining work is to bound, unconditionally from an `S1` start, the two
occupation cross-terms produced by chaining through `Done₁ = {activeBCount = 0}`
and `Done₂ = {activeTCount = 0}`.  Both are closed by the generic
`occupation_mid_le_on` (the strong-Markov restart): from an `Sᵢ`-start the band
mass concentrates on `Sᵢ`-states (`InvClosed`), where the next-stage hitting bound
applies.  The key uniform cap is `wrongACount/activeTCount ≤ card = n ≤ n(n−1)`. -/

/-! ## Tie case (`backupSignal = 0`, i.e. `phase10ActiveSignedSum = 0`)

When the signed active sum is `0`, `activeACount = activeBCount` throughout, so the
majority invariant's `0 < phase10ActiveSignedSum` fails.  The stabilization is
two-stage:

* **Tie cancel stage** `Φ := activeBCount` on `Tie1 := AllPhase10 ∧ card = n ∧
  signedSum = 0`.  The cancel drop-prob `activeBCount_drop_prob` needs `1 ≤
  activeACount`; under `Tie1` with `activeBCount = m ≥ 1`, `activeACount = m ≥ 1`
  holds (signed sum `0`), so it applies VERBATIM.  After this stage
  `activeACount = activeBCount = 0` (signed sum `0`), so every remaining active
  agent is active-`T`.

* **T-spread stage** `Φ := wrongTCount` on `Tie2 := Tie1 ∧ activeBCount = 0`
  (whence also `activeACount = 0`).  An active-`T` converts any non-active-biased
  partner to output `T`; under `Tie2` every non-`T` agent is passive (not
  active-A/B), so it is a valid conversion target.  This is the genuinely new drop
  family `wrongTCount_drop_prob`.

The two stages chain through `Done = {activeBCount = 0}` exactly as in the majority
case, the cross-term closed by `occupation_mid_le_on` with `J = Tie1`. -/

`wrongACount_drop_prob`), swapping the driver class active-A → active-T and the
responder class "wrong-not-activeB" → "wrong-not-biased" (output ≠ T and not active

the responder count equals `wrongTCount`. -/
