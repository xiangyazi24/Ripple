# LateFloor — the low-`u` checkpoint completion (the `hlate` slot of `floor_prefix_le`)

This file discharges the **late-band** floor residual that `FloorPrefix.floor_prefix_le`
carries as its named `hlate` hypothesis:

  `∑ τ ∈ range t, (K^(T₀+τ)) c₀ {c | lateBandBad n a₀ uMin hn2 c} ≤ εlate`

where `lateBandBad = shell ∧ mcrCount < uMin ∧ pool < a₀ ∧ ¬ roleSplitGoodMile`.  It is
**append-only** and edits no existing file; it imports the (frozen) consumer chain
`KilledTailConsumers` (the contractive killed-tail mid-band feeder + the Gap-2 first-escape
pattern), which transitively brings `FloorPrefix`, `FloorMasses`, `KilledAffineTail`,
`RoleSplitConcentration`.

## The blueprint §1 Region L doctrine (HANDOFF_EFLOOR_PREFIX.md)

In the low-`u` regime the floor martingale **stalls**: Rule-1 births fire at rate
`u(u−1)/(n(n−1))`, which for `u < uMin` is too weak to sustain the `exp(−s·pool)` drift.
So the warm-up/floor-maintenance MGF (`midBand_floorFail_prefix_floorMasses`, which needs
`uMin ≤ freshMcrCount`) is **not available** here.  The honest argument is a **race**, and
the structural fact that makes it work is:

  `lateBandBad ⊆ {pool < a₀}`   AND   `lateBandBad ⊆ {¬ roleSplitGoodMile}`.

So the late-band mass is bounded by EITHER:

* **the floor-deficit MGF** `{pool < a₀}` — the genuinely-new low-`u` floor-deficit tail,
  bounded by the **contractive killed engine** `midBand_real_contractive_tail` at the
  pool MGF `poolExpNeg s`, with an affine drift `∫ poolExpNeg d(K x) ≤ r·poolExpNeg x + b`
  supplied ON the late-band gate (the gate carries the drift parameters `r`, `b` as the
  honest low-`u` analytic input — `b > 0` because immigration into the deficit replaces the
  stalled multiplicative contraction); or

* **the Stage-1 completion tail** `{¬ roleSplitGoodMile}` — Stage 1 has not yet drained
  `mcrCount` to `≤ 1`.  Since `mcrCount ≤ uMin` is SMALL at the `LowStartGood` start, the
  remaining Stage-1 work is short; the milestone/Janson machinery
  (`real_bad_le_janson_add_escape` with the floor-driven `roleSplitKernelMilestone`,
  `pMin·meanTime = Θ(log n)`) bounds the completion failure.

The **race assembly** takes the minimum: the floor holds AT START (`pool ≥ 2a₀ ≥ a₀`), and
the run COMPLETES Stage 1 before the floor (which the contractive deficit tail suppresses)
fails — so `late_prefix_le` charges `lateBandBad` to the contractive floor-deficit killed
tail, the cleanest GENUINELY-DECAYING object (no `1 ≤ r`).  `εlate` lands at the aggregate
of the per-prefix contractive tails, targeting `1/(3n²)` per the §4 budget split.

## What is PROVEN here, end-to-end (0-sorry, axiom-clean)

* `lateBandBad_subset_floorFail` / `lateBandBad_subset_notDone` — the dual pointwise cover
  (pure logic);
* `lateBand_step_contractive` — the per-step late-band mass ≤ contractive killed tail +
  escape, via `FloorPrefix.midBand_floorFail_step_contractive` at the pool MGF (the genuine
  low-`u` floor-deficit MGF — the affine drift is the named low-`u` analytic input);
* `lateBand_prefix_contractive` — the prefix aggregate (the `εlate`-shape feeder);
* `late_prefix_le` — the `hlate`-slot statement at a given `εlate`, from the named
  per-prefix late-band bound;
* `floor_prefix_le_with_late` — the full `floor_prefix_le` wired with `hlate` discharged by
  the contractive late-band route (the `εwarm`/`εmid` slots stay as the
  `FloorPrefix`/`KilledTailConsumers` feeders);
* `εlate` (`= 1/(3n²)`) and `late_prefix_le_inv` (the paper-scale capstone).

The low-`u` analytic drift parameters (`r`, `b`) and the deterministic floor-exit escape
bridge stay as PRECISELY-NAMED residuals — the honest remaining count-mass content of
Region L, exactly where the blueprint flags the floor martingale as genuinely stalled.

/-! ## Stage 1 — the joint `(pool, u)` ledger: the dual pointwise cover of `lateBandBad`.

The late-band event `lateBandBad = shell ∧ u < uMin ∧ pool < a₀ ∧ ¬done` requires BOTH the
floor failure `pool < a₀` AND the Stage-1 incompletion `¬ roleSplitGoodMile`.  So the
late-band mass is bounded by EITHER marginal event — the two ends of the race.  These covers
are pure logic.  The per-step pool ledger (`pool c − 2 ≤ pool c'` a.e.) is the deterministic
`±2` range that bounds how fast the pool can fall while `u` drains, reused verbatim from
`FloorMasses.pool_step_ge_ae`. -/

/-- **The late-band ⊆ floor-failure cover.**  Every late-band configuration has `pool < a₀`
(the floor has failed).  This routes the late-band mass into the floor-deficit MGF — the
contractive killed engine. -/

`FloorMasses.pool_step_ge_ae`: on the one-step kernel from any `c`, almost every successor
has `pool c − 2 ≤ pool c'`.  This is the rate at which the pool can fall while `u` drains —
the honest "pool falls at most `2` per step" structure of the race (over the
`O(n log n / a₀)`-flavored remaining time the cumulative drain is what the contractive
deficit tail suppresses). -/

/-! ## Stage 2 — the completion tail: from `LowStartGood`, Stage-1 incompletion is small.

The race's "fast" side.  `lateBandBad ⊆ {¬ roleSplitGoodMile}`, and from the `LowStartGood`
start the floor holds (`pool ≥ 2a₀ ≥ a₀`), so the floor-driven milestone witness
`roleSplitKernelMilestone` fires and its Janson hitting-time tail bounds the completion
failure.  Since `mcrCount ≤ uMin` is small, the remaining work is short.  We expose the
completion-tail bound as a named feeder (the milestone start condition from `LowStartGood` is
the named hypothesis `hPre_low` — the low-`u` analogue of `roleSplitKernelMilestone_hPre`,
which the all-MCR `Phase0Initial` start gives but a generic `LowStartGood` checkpoint must
carry). -/

/-- **The late completion tail (race "fast" side).**  From a gate start `c₀ ∈ floorGate n a₀`
(the `LowStartGood` checkpoint, where the floor still holds), the milestone/Janson machinery
bounds the Stage-1 incompletion mass `{¬ roleSplitGoodMile}` by the Janson hitting-time tail
PLUS the floor-escape union budget.  This is `phase0_stage1_whp` re-exposed with the start
condition `hPre` as the named low-`u` hypothesis `hPre_low` (a generic checkpoint, unlike the
all-MCR `Phase0Initial`, must carry "no milestone has fired yet").  The completion tail is the
alternative race bound on `lateBandBad`. -/

/-! ## Stage 3 — the race assembly: `lateBandBad` ≤ contractive floor-deficit killed tail.

The genuinely-new low-`u` probabilistic piece.  Route the late-band mass through the
floor-failure cover `lateBandBad ⊆ {pool < a₀}` and the **contractive killed engine**
`FloorPrefix.midBand_floorFail_step_contractive` (delivered in `KilledAffineTail`,
`r < 1` allowed because `killΦ none = 0` makes the `1 ≤ r` requirement spurious).  The affine
drift on the late-band gate `G` is the named low-`u` analytic input (`r`, `b`): in Region L
the multiplicative birth contraction stalls, so the honest drift carries an immigration term
`b > 0`; the killed tail `(rᵗ·poolExpNeg(x) + b∑rⁱ)/θ` still DECAYS when `r < 1`, which is the
point.  The escape is the deterministic floor-exit (gate-breach) mass. -/

/-- **The per-step late-band contractive bound (race "slow" side, genuinely-new low-`u`
floor-deficit MGF).**  From a gate start `x ∈ G`, the late-band mass `{lateBandBad}` at step
`t` is bounded by the GENUINELY-DECAYING contractive killed pool tail `(rᵗ·poolExpNeg(x) +
b∑rⁱ)/θ` (`r` the low-`u` drift rate, `b` its immigration, `θ = exp(−s·a₀)`) PLUS the
gate-exit escape mass.  This routes the late band through the floor-failure cover into the
`r < 1` contractive engine — the cleanest decaying object, no `1 ≤ r`. -/

leading term.  This is the object `floor_prefix_le`'s `hlate` slot consumes (modulo the gate
start membership, threaded by the consumer).  The gate `G` and drift `(r, b)` are the named

The assembled floor-prefix theorem `floor_prefix_le` carries three named region masses
(`hshell`, `hmid`, `hlate`).  Here we re-state it with the `hlate` slot discharged by the
contractive late-band route (`late_prefix_le`), exposing the genuinely-new low-`u` piece as
the named drift hypothesis, and leaving `hshell`/`hmid` as their existing feeders
(`FloorPrefix` / `KilledTailConsumers`). -/
