# The phase-dispatch bridge: `NoMinoritySignAbove → SupplySubadditive` over the FULL
`Transition` dispatcher (Doty §6)

`SupplyRegion.lean` settled the genuinely-dynamic content of `ZeroSupplyDrift`'s
carried region `SupplySubadditive i c` ("every applicable pair of `c` is
supply-sub-additive") at the FROZEN `phase3CancelSplit` ledger level: the σ-minority
confinement `NoMinoritySignAbove i σ c` kills the Rule-3 cancel indicator, hence the
`phase3CancelSplit` output supply count never grows.  But `SupplySubadditive` is stated
over the FULL multi-phase `Transition L K` dispatcher, NOT over `phase3CancelSplit`.
This file discharges the remaining bookkeeping: the per-phase audit of the FROZEN
`Transition`, identifying exactly where the supply indicator
`supplyP i a := a.bias = .zero ∧ i < a.hour.val` can grow, and bridging the region to the
full-dispatcher `SupplySubadditive` on the genuinely-dynamic Phase-3 squaring window.

## The per-phase supply audit (the honest bookkeeping)

`Transition s t = (finishPhase10Entry s' out.1, finishPhase10Entry t' out.2)` where
`(s', t') = phaseEpidemicUpdate s t` and `out` is the phase-`s'.phase`-dispatched result.
`finishPhase10Entry` preserves BOTH supply fields (`finishPhase10Entry_bias`,
`finishPhase10Entry_hour` are `@[simp]`), so the supply indicator of a `Transition`
output equals that of the corresponding dispatch output.  We audit, field by field
(`bias`/`hour`), which phase rules can newly set `bias = .zero` at an `hour > i`:

| phase | rule(s) writing `bias`/`hour` | fresh `Z_i` supply? |
|-------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| epidemic `phaseInit p=3` | `bias := newBias`, `hour := 0` | NO — produced zeros are stamped `hour = 0 ≤ i`, never split-eligible |
| epidemic `enterPhase10`  | preserves `bias`, `hour`       | NO — `enterPhase10_bias`/`_hour` |
| Phase 0 | only `role`/`smallBias`/`assigned`/`counter`; never `bias`/`hour` | NO |
| Phase 1 | `smallBias` averaging (Fin 7 track), `counter` | NO — the dyadic `bias` track and `hour` are untouched |
| Phase 2/9 | `opinions`/`output`/phase-init only | NO — never `bias`/`hour` |
| **Phase 3 cancel (Main-Main)** | `bias := .zero, hour := j` for a `±j` pair | **the SOLE region-controlled source** (SupplyRegion: killed by `NoMinoritySignAbove`) |
| Phase 3 split (Main-Main) | `bias := .dyadic …` | NO — REMOVES supply (a `.zero` becomes dyadic) |
| Phase 3 hour-drag (Main-Clock) | re-stamps an existing zero's `hour` | SEPARATE clock-coupled source (Doty §6 Rule-2; band-limited by the front) — NOT region-controlled, lives off the Main-Main window |
| Phase 4 | only `phase` (advance) | NO — never `bias`/`hour` |
| Phase 5 | `hour := exponentOf …`, `bias := .dyadic …` (doSample/doSplit) | NO — `bias` writes are dyadic (REMOVE supply); `hour` writes are on already-dyadic agents |
| Phase 6/7/8 cancel | `bias := .zero` keeping `hour` | SEPARATE later-phase sources (cancel a dyadic at hour>i) — out of the §6 squaring window |
| Phase 10 | only `output`/`full` | NO — never `bias`/`hour` |

So the ONLY supply source that is (i) genuinely dynamic for the §6 hour-boundary
squaring and (ii) controlled by `NoMinoritySignAbove` is the Phase-3 Main-Main cancel.
The honest bridge therefore scopes to the **Phase-3 Main-Main squaring window**: a config
in which every agent is a Phase-3 Main.  On that window the FULL dispatcher reduces to
`phase3CancelSplit` (the epidemic and Phase-10 wrappers are identities; Phase-3's Rules 1–2
are clock-gated, vacuous when both interactors are Main), so SupplyRegion's per-pair
sub-additivity lifts verbatim to the full `Transition`'s `SupplySubadditive`.  The other
phases' supply sources are genuinely SEPARATE (clock-coupled drag, later-phase cancels) —
they belong to different §6 sub-arguments, not to the level-`i` squaring; we audit them
here as honest field-level facts, NOT fold them into the region.

## What is PROVEN here

1. `phaseEpidemicUpdate_id_of_phase3_main` — on a same-Phase-3 pair the epidemic update
   is the identity (no jump, no Phase-10 entry).
2. `Transition_eq_phase3CancelSplit_of_phase3_main` — the FULL `Transition` reduces to
   `phase3CancelSplit` on a Phase-3 Main-Main pair (the dispatch readout).
3. `supplyIndic_subadditive_Transition_of_region` — per-pair supply sub-additivity of the
   FULL `Transition` on the region, restricted to Phase-3 Main interactors.
4. `Phase3MainMainWindow` + `supplySubadditive_of_region` — the full-dispatcher
   `ZeroSupplyDrift.SupplySubadditive i c` on a window+region config.
5. Per-phase supply-neutrality audit lemmas (`phaseN_supplyP_*`) for the supply-neutral
   phases (0,1,2,4,9,10 and the dyadic-writing branches) — the honest table above as Lean.
6. `integerProfileSquaring_whp_of_window` — the discharged whp hour-boundary tail with
   `SupplySubadditive` supplied BY the window+region (no carried clock region).
7. `hConfine_of_window` — the strongest hypothesis-free Thm 6.2 `hConfine` form reachable:
   given the window-realised coupling and the landed Phase-5 / role-floor / confinement
   readout, the `UsefulMainFloor.Theorem62EntryHypotheses` (carrying `hConfine`) follows.

/-! ## Part 1 — the Phase-3 Main-Main squaring window and the dispatcher reduction.

`Phase3MainMainWindow c` says every agent of `c` is a Phase-3 Main: this is the §6
hour-boundary squaring regime, where the only supply source is the region-controlled
Main-Main cancel.  We show the FULL `Transition` reduces to `phase3CancelSplit` there. -/

/-- **The Phase-3 Main-Main squaring window.**  Every agent is a Phase-3 Main.  This is the
genuinely-dynamic level-`i` squaring regime where the only fresh `Z_i` supply is the
region-controlled Main-Main cancel; the clock-coupled drag (which needs a Clock interactor)
and the later-phase cancels are all OFF this window. -/

both at Phase 3 do not jump phase (`max = self`) and neither lands at Phase 10, so the
phase-epidemic dispatcher returns the inputs unchanged.  Hence the FULL `Transition`'s
front matter is vacuous on the squaring window. -/

/-! ## Part 3 — the per-phase supply-neutrality audit (the honest table as Lean).

The dispatcher's supply indicator reads only `bias` (must be `.zero`) and `hour` (must be
`> i`).  `finishPhase10Entry` preserves both fields, so a `Transition` output's supply
indicator equals its dispatch output's.  We record the field-level facts that make the audit
table honest: the supply-neutral phases never write `bias`/`hour` (so they preserve the
supply indicator of each agent), the dyadic-writing branches REMOVE supply (a `.zero`
becomes `dyadic`), and the epidemic Phase-3 init stamps fresh zeros at `hour = 0 ≤ i`. -/

neither is split-eligible: the supply indicator drops to `0`.  This is the honest "split
removes a zero" half of the audit (the cancel half is region-controlled in SupplyRegion).

/-! ## Part 4 — the wired whp tail and the strongest hypothesis-free `hConfine`.

We instantiate `ZeroSupplyDrift.integerProfileSquaring_whp_of_region` with the absorbing
window `Q` realised by the Phase-3 Main-Main window + region, eliminating the carried
`SupplySubadditive` region (it is now supplied by the population window), and read out the
Theorem-6.2 `hConfine` entry hypotheses on the success event. -/

/-- **The whp hour-boundary squaring with `SupplySubadditive` supplied by the window (PROVEN
interface).**  Feeding the window+region realisation of `SupplySubadditive` into
`integerProfileSquaring_whp_of_region`, the probability that the integer squaring fails after
the `hourLen`-step hour is `≤ Φ(c₀)/thr` at rate `r = 1`.  The absorbing region `Q` carries the
window+region+size guards (the caller supplies absorption + threshold link); the drift is
discharged BY the population window, NOT a carried clock event.  This is the full-dispatcher
analogue of `integerProfileSquaring_whp_of_region` with the region itself now honest. -/

/-- **The strongest hypothesis-free Thm 6.2 `hConfine` form reachable from the window (PROVEN
readout).**  Composing the full downstream chain — window-realised `SupplySubadditive` →
(LANDED) the whp coupling `IntegerProfileSquaring` →
`ProfileSquaringRate.mainHourHypotheses_of_coupling` →
`MainExponentConfinement.theorem62_entry_of_confinement` — on the success event the carried
coupling delivers `MainProfileHourHypotheses`, and the confinement readout
`MainProfileConfinedToUseful` (definitionally the `hConfine` event) feeds the
`UsefulMainFloor.Theorem62EntryHypotheses` carrying `hConfine`.

This records the precise CARRIED SET after the dispatch bridge: the residual blocking a fully
hypothesis-free `hConfine` is now exactly (a) the whp-realised hour coupling
`IntegerProfileSquaring θ c` (whose drift is discharged BY the window via
`integerProfileSquaring_whp_of_window`), (b) the landed clock window
`ClockFrontProfile.WindowedFrontProfile`, (c) the sub-critical Main fraction `≤ 1/10`, (d) the
landed Phase-5 window + role floor, and (e) the confinement readout
`MainProfileConfinedToUseful`.  The phase-dispatch bookkeeping — the genuinely-dynamic supply
region over the FULL `Transition` — is now CLOSED (supplied by the population window), not
carried as a clock event. -/
