# Doty Thm 3.1 time half — the post-Lemma-6.3 campaign plan

_Drafted 2026-06-09 evening, while agent 3 closes the last Lemma-6.3 wiring item (hB).
Position at drafting: windowedFrontProfile_whp + goodFrontWidth_whp + climbBound_whp landed on the
real kernel (0-sorry, axiom-clean, uisai2-verified ×3). This file plans everything from there to
the unconditional Theorem 3.1 time half._

## Where the campaign stands

PROVEN (real kernel, whp, modulo the hB instantiation in flight):
- The §6 coupled time-window engine: per-level squaring recurrence (Thm 6.5 windowed form),
  GoodFrontWidth = the moving-frame width invariant, ClimbBound. This was the deep core.
- Lemma 6.10 hour coupling (HourCouplingV2, Azuma) — proven earlier, not yet wired.
- Phases 2 & 9 untimed PhaseConvergence instances.
- The abstract AND transferred real-kernel per-minute clock machinery (ClockReal* chain) — but its
  FrontSync maintenance still consumes the FALSE `hwin_all`; that consumption is what Phase B fixes.
- Correctness half: complete (stable_majority_correct).

## Phase B — the clock rewire (drop `hwin_all`)  [first; ~12–18 bricks]

Goal: the real-kernel per-hour O(log n) clock as an unconditional whp theorem.
1. **Fix the concrete parameters ONCE, up front**: θn(n), tt(n), w(n), KK(n), Tcap, the scale
   floor N₀ (currently n ≥ 25641, θn ≥ 30000 carried abstractly). Every later discharge uses these;
   choosing them first avoids rework. Deliverable: a `DotyParams`-style structure or a fixed set of
   defs + the norm_num facts they satisfy.
2. Discharge the carried scale hypotheses of windowedFrontProfile_whp_packaged / goodFrontWidth_whp /
   climbBound_whp at those parameters → clean whp statements with hypotheses `N₀ ≤ n` only.
3. Rethread the FrontSync consumers: FrontSyncConc / ClockFrontWidth / ClockEnvMaint /
   ClockFullJoint currently carry `hwin_all` (FALSE as ∀-reachable). Replace the input with the
   GoodFrontWidth-whp event via `frontSync_of_goodWidth_of_bulk_below` (deterministic glue, proven)
   + a horizon union. NOTE: not a find-replace — the existing statements are shaped for a
   deterministic invariant; they need whp-event versions (mirror how real_front_squares_whp wraps
   its event). Audit each consumer file for what it actually needs.
4. Re-derive `clock_real_faithful_O_log_n` (the composed per-hour clock) on the rewired inputs;
   retire the false-hypothesis variants; update `clock_honest_verdict`.

## Phase C — the timed phase instances  [the volume; ~25–35 bricks; PARALLELIZABLE]

A1's `compose_n_phases` (PhaseConvergence.lean) needs 11 instances; 2 & 9 exist. Remaining:
- Phase 3 = the clock itself → falls out of Phase B (the big one).
- Phases 0, 1: initialization + role assignment + smallBias counters. Includes the **clock-count
  Θ(n)** concentration (the role split) — an input the clock constants implicitly need; make it
  explicit here.
- Phases 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10: per-phase epidemics / counter timeouts at constant fraction — A0-style
  analyses on existing machinery (ConstantDensityEpidemic, WindowConcentration, stdCounter timing,
  the new gated engines where rates are conditional).
PARALLELIZATION: each phase analysis goes in ITS OWN new file (Phase4Convergence.lean, …) so
multiple subagents can run concurrently without single-file races. Phase 2/9's existing instance
(Phase2Convergence.lean) is the template.
Risk note: phases 5–8 interact with Reserve agents & sampling (paper §7.1) — read the paper section
before speccing each; do not guess the per-phase event structure.

## Phase D — composition  [~8–12 bricks]

1. Wire Lemma 6.10 (hour_coupling_v2) + the Phase-B clock into the phase-3 timed instance
   (hours advance together ⟹ the phase-3 window closes in O(log n)).
2. `compose_n_phases` with all 11 instances → `doty_time_headline` UNCONDITIONAL:
   stabilization in O(log n) parallel time whp. Update every honest-verdict marker.

## Phase E — expected time  [~8–15 bricks]  — SCOPED 2026-06-10 (paper read done)

Paper's argument (§7 wrap-up, "We finally justify that the expected stabilization time is
O(n log n) [interactions]"): three-event split AT TIME 0, not a from-any-reachable-config restart:
- **Good** (whp ≥ 1 − O(1/n²)): all phase whp-events hold → stabilize in O(log n) parallel time.
- **Bad-with-big-clock** (prob ≤ O(1/n²), |C| ≥ 0.24n by Lemma 5.2 whp): timed phases still
  advance via counters in expected O(log n) each (Thm 6.9 + Chernoff on counter rounds), untimed
  phases pass by epidemic expected O(log n) → reach backup Phase 10, which stabilizes in expected
  O(n log n) parallel time (**Lemma 7.7**). Contribution O(1/n²)·O(n log n) = o(1).
- **Tiny-clock** (|C| = o(n); note |C| ≥ 2 always by Lemma 5.2's deterministic part, and |C| is
  FIXED after Phase 0): probability super-polynomially small; conditional time at most poly(n)
  (counter decrements at rate ≥ |C|/n ≥ 2/n). Negligible product.

Lean bricks:
- **E1** `Probability/ExpectedHitting.lean` (NEW): hitting-time expectation toolkit on kernel
  powers. E[T] = ∑_t P(T > t) (or block form E[T] ≤ s·∑_k P(T > k·s)); the geometric-tail lemma
  (∀ config in a closed class, P(not done in s steps) ≤ q ⟹ P(T > k·s) ≤ q^k ⟹ E[T] ≤ s/(1−q));
  the conditioning-free split E[T] ≤ t₀ + ∑_{t≥t₀} P(T>t). Generic, no protocol content.
  **DONE 2026-06-10** (0-sorry, axiom-clean = [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] on all 13
  thms; single-file EXIT_0). Generic over `K : Kernel α α` `[IsMarkovKernel K]` + fixed measurable
  `Done` set + absorption hyp `∀ x ∈ Done, K x Doneᶜ = 0` (matches GeometricDrift's generic style,
  so it applies directly to `(NonuniformMajority L K).transitionKernel`). Design choice: closure
  class is taken to be `Doneᶜ` itself — the per-block hypothesis is `∀ b ∈ Doneᶜ, (K^s) b Doneᶜ ≤ q`
  ("from every not-done state, s steps finish w.p. ≥ 1−q"), no separate invariant-class bookkeeping
  needed. `expectedHitting K c Done := ∑' t, (K^t) c Doneᶜ` (= E[T] under the standard tail-sum
  identity). Delivered (signatures abbreviated, all in namespace `ExactMajority`):
  - `expectedHitting` (def), `expectedHitting_eq_tsum`.
  - `bad_antitone` / `bad_antitone_le` — `(K^t) c Doneᶜ` antitone in `t` from absorption (Lemma 0).
  - `pow_absorbing` — `Done` absorbing for 1 step ⟹ absorbing for m steps.
  - `expectedHitting_le_block` — `E[T] ≤ s · ∑' k, (K^(k·s)) c Doneᶜ` (block form, `s ≠ 0`).
  - `bad_block_contracts_from` / `bad_block_contracts` — `(K^(m+s)) c₀ Doneᶜ ≤ q·(K^m) c₀ Doneᶜ`.
  - `bad_block_geometric` — `(K^(k·s)) c₀ Doneᶜ ≤ q^k`.
  - `expectedHitting_geometric` — `E[T] ≤ s · (1−q)⁻¹`.
  - `kernel_pow_le_one`, `expectedHitting_split` — `E[T] ≤ t₀ + ∑' t, (K^(t₀+t)) c Doneᶜ`.
  - `tail_le_block`, `bad_block_geometric_from` — shifted-base block + geometric helpers.
  - `expectedHitting_split_geometric` — **Phase-E4 capstone**: hyps `(K^t₀) c₀ Doneᶜ ≤ δ` +
    per-block `q` (`s≠0`) ⟹ `E[T] ≤ t₀ + δ·s·(1−q)⁻¹`. Nothing left out.
- **E2** Lemma 7.7: Phase-10 backup expected O(n log n) parallel time. Correctness-side
  infrastructure exists (Analysis/Phase10Backup.lean: signed sums, active counts). Probability
  side: cancel/spread reactions at rate ≥ activeCount²/n²-style → coupon-collector/geometric

  - **REMAINING = pure protocol instantiation** (2 bricks, both in Analysis/Phase10Backup land; engine
    carries no further obligation). Precise goals (also in Phase10ExpectedTime.lean tail doc):
    (B1) `PotNonincr K Φ` (Φ∈{activeBCount,wrongACount}): support template
    (Phase0Convergence.phaseBelowCount_step_le) ⇒ per-pair `Φ{Transition r₁ r₂}≤Φ{r₁,r₂}` via
    countP additivity. **SCOPING CAVEAT** (newly pinned): per-pair bound is FALSE for the full
    kernel — enterPhase10/epidemic entry create active-B. Holds only on phase-10-restricted
    subdynamics ⇒ must run stages on absorbed/restricted kernel under all-phase-10 invariant, OR
    add a PotNonincr-relative-to-invariant engine variant. Invariant-threading = brick 1.
    (B2) per-level drop qₘ=1-m/(n(n-1)): needs real-kernel analogue of step_advance_prob
    (interactionPMF(r₁,r₂) mass lower bound for an applicable AgentState pair, via stepDist=map
    scheduledStep interactionPMF as in ClockOLogN/ClockFaithful) + class-aggregation: SUM that
    mass over the Finset of active-A×active-B useful pairs to reach ≥m/(n(n-1)) (state-multiplicity).
    Brick 2 = largest. Stage chaining via expectedHitting_le_through_mid, majority/tie via backupSignal.
  - **E2-10** SHA abb46a67: **B1 GENERIC invariant-relative engine DELIVERED** (design choice =
    invariant-threading, NOT restricted-kernel — cheaper, reuses abstract InvClosed instead of
    building a new kernel). New in Phase10ExpectedTime.lean (Coupon section): `InvClosed K Inv`

  - **CRITICAL SCOPING REFINEMENT (E2-13 discovery, supersedes the B1 caveat above).** The
    `PotNonincrOn Phase10EpidemicPost K activeBCount` hypothesis the engine needs is **FALSE even on
    all-phase-10 configs**: `Phase10Transition` Block 2 (active converts passive) makes a passive agent
    ADOPT an active-B partner's output → a NEW active-B. So activeBCount can INCREASE under phase-10 when
    both active-A AND active-B are present. The honest non-increase invariant is sharper:
      * **cancel stage** (Φ=activeBCount): NOT non-increasing under any phase-10-only invariant. The
        correct monotone is that the signed sum `activeACount−activeBCount` is CONSERVED
        (`phase10Transition_preserves_signedContribution`, public). In majority-A (signed sum = g > 0
        fixed), `activeBCount` is bounded by `activeACount = activeBCount + g` and DROPS to 0 by the cancel
        reaction; the engine should run on `Φ = activeBCount` with `Inv = {AllPhase10 ∧ signed sum = g}` —
        but non-increase still needs the no-spread argument. SIMPLEST FIX: the cancel stage is a single
        descent to activeBCount=0; use the E1 supermartingale/hitting bound directly with the conserved
        signed sum, OR add `activeBCount ≤ activeACount` to Inv and prove block-2 spread of B requires a
        passive partner which when present means activeACount also can spread (net signed conserved).
      * **coupon stages** (Φ=wrongACount, AFTER activeBCount=0): clean. `Inv = {AllPhase10 ∧ activeBCount=0}`
        is support-closed (no B present + signed sum = activeACount ≥ 0 ⇒ no B reappears: block-2 only
        spreads the present active outputs, all A/T) and under it `wrongACount` IS non-increasing (only A
        spreads / absorbs). This is the engine's clean instantiation. The activeBCount_drop_prob route
        (E2-13) transfers verbatim to wrongACount via the analogous public output lemmas
        (Phase10Transition_activeA_nonActiveB_outputs_A) — same rectangle aggregation, active-A × not-A.
    NET: B1 generic engine + B2 drop-probability machinery are DONE and axiom-clean. The remaining
    instantiation = (i) choose Inv per stage (cancel: signed-sum-conserved; coupon: AllPhase10∧activeBCount=0),
    (ii) prove `InvClosed` + `PotNonincrOn` for the COUPON stage (clean, no-B-spread), (iii) handle the
    cancel stage via conserved signed sum (the activeBCount monotone is subtler than a plain PotNonincrOn).
    All `_on` engine lemmas + the drop-probability lemma are reusable as-is.
  - **E2-14** SHA aedcbe8e: B2 coupon-stage per-pair drop (`wrongACount_post_convert_lt`,
    `scheduledStep_activeA_wrongB_in_drop`) via public `Phase10Transition_activeA_nonActiveB_outputs_A`.
  - **E2-15** SHA 7aae202f: **B2 coupon-stage DROP PROBABILITY DELIVERED**. `WrongNotActiveB` class,
    `activeAWrongPairs`, `sum_interactionCount_activeAWrong = activeACount·wrongNotBCount`,
    `wrongNotBCount_eq_wrongACount_of_no_activeB` (post-cancel bridge), `wrongACount_drop_prob`:
    on all-phase-10 with activeBCount=0 & activeACount≥1, `kernel c (dropTarget wrongACount c) ≥
    wrongACount c/(n(n-1))`. Both stages' drop probabilities now axiom-clean.
  - **FURTHER SCOPING REFINEMENT (E2-15 discovery).** `wrongACount` is ALSO not cleanly non-increasing
    even under {AllPhase10 ∧ activeBCount=0}: `Phase10Transition` Block 2 lets an active-**T** spread T
    onto a passive whose output is A → that agent becomes output-T (≠A), so `wrongACount` INCREASES.
    The honest three-stage invariant chain (matches Doty's order):
      1. **cancel** Φ=activeBCount, Inv₁={AllPhase10}, drop via `activeBCount_drop_prob` (DONE). Monotone
         subtlety: activeBCount not non-increasing (B-spread) — use conserved signed sum
         (activeACount−activeBCount=g>0, `phase10Transition_preserves_signedContribution` public) so
         activeBCount≤activeACount and the cancel reaction is the only signed-sum-preserving move that
         changes the pair; alternatively bound the cancel hitting time by the E1 one-step engine on the
         {activeBCount>0} event directly (drop prob ≥ activeBCount/(n²) ≥ 1/(n²)).
      2. **absorb-T** Φ=activeTCount, Inv₂={AllPhase10 ∧ activeBCount=0}, useful pairs active-A×active-T
         (active-A absorbs active-T → both A; `Phase10Transition_activeA_nonActiveB_outputs_A` covers it).
         The drop-probability lemma transfers verbatim (swap WrongNotActiveB→IsActiveT). Under Inv₂,
         activeTCount IS non-increasing (no A→T move when no active-B; active-T only gets absorbed).
      3. **convert-passive** Φ=wrongACount, Inv₃={AllPhase10 ∧ activeBCount=0 ∧ activeTCount=0}, useful
         pairs active-A×{output≠A} (`wrongACount_drop_prob`, DONE, holds under Inv₃ a fortiori). Under
         Inv₃ (only active-A and passives left) wrongACount IS non-increasing (active-A only spreads A).
    **REMAINING for full E2 capstone** (all engine + all drop-prob lemmas done):
      (a) prove `InvClosed K Invᵢ` for i=2,3 (Inv₂ closure: no B reappears from no-B — block-2 spreads
          only present active outputs {A,T}; Inv₃ closure: additionally no active-T reappears once gone,
          since A-spread makes A and T-absorb makes A). Re-derivable in-file from public per-pair output
          lemmas + the support template `ae_of_stepDistOrSelf_support_preserved`.
      (b) prove `PotNonincrOn Invᵢ K Φᵢ` per-pair (the full output case-analysis on Phase10Transition,
          ~the private activeBCount/wrongACount _lt lemmas generalized to ≤ for all pair types under Invᵢ).
      (c) instantiate `coupon_expectedHitting_le_uniform_on` per stage with qₘ=1−m/(n(n-1)) (from the
          drop-prob lemmas: `K b (potBelow Φ m)ᶜ = 1 − K b (dropTarget) ≤ 1 − m/(n(n-1))` when Φ b=m),
          chain via `expectedHitting_le_through_mid`, majority/tie split on `backupSignal` sign.
    The probability/coupon/drop machinery carries NO further obligation; remaining is (a)+(b) per-pair
    monotonicity case-analysis (Analysis-style, re-derivable in-file) + (c) mechanical assembly.

    KEY CORRECTION TO THE DOCTRINE: `activeBCount` IS non-increasing on all-phase-10 (no extra invariant
    needed). The doctrine's repeated "Block-2 B-spread creates a new active-B" concern (lines ~180-189,
    214-217) is FALSE per the actual `Phase10Transition` def: Block 2 (active→passive spread) sets the
    converted partner's `output` but leaves `full := false`, so it never creates a new active source.
    Brute-force `Transition_activeBCount_le` (full output × full case analysis) compiles directly. The
    conserved-signed-sum workaround for the cancel stage is therefore UNNECESSARY for monotonicity.
    Delivered in `Probability/Phase10ExpectedTime.lean` (single-file EXIT_0, append-only; no Analysis edit):
      * Per-pair monotonicity `Transition_{activeBCount,activeTCount,wrongACount}_le` (brute force;
        activeTCount needs no-active-B in pair, wrongACount needs no-active-B & no-active-T).
      * Kernel-lift template `countP_scheduledStep_le` + `potNonincrOn_of_countP_step`; from these,
        `PotNonincrOn` for all 3 stages (`potNonincrOn_{activeBCount,activeTCount,wrongACount}`).
      * `InvClosed` for `AllPhase10`/`Inv2`/`Inv3` AND for the richer majority invariants `S1/S2/S3`
        (which additionally carry `card = n` and `0 < phase10ActiveSignedSum`, conserved per-step via
        `phase10ActiveSignedSum_stepRel_eq` + `stepDistOrSelf_support_card_eq`).
      * q-wiring: `qLevel n m = 1 − m/(n(n−1))`, `drop_compl_le` (complement via `measure_compl` +
        Markov `measure_univ`), `qLevel_uniform_ceiling` ((1−qLevel)⁻¹ ≤ n(n−1) for 1≤m≤M≤n(n−1)).
      * NEW drop-prob `activeTCount_drop_prob` (active-A × active-T rectangle; mirrors
        `wrongACount_drop_prob` verbatim — the doctrine's "swap WrongNotActiveB→IsActiveT" prediction).
      * THREE STAGE BOUNDS (full `coupon_expectedHitting_le_uniform_on` instantiations on the REAL kernel):
        `stage1_expectedHitting_le` (cancel, activeBCount), `stage2_expectedHitting_le` (absorb-T,
        activeTCount), `stage3_expectedHitting_le` (convert-passive, wrongACount). Each gives
        `E[hit {Φ=0}] ≤ M·n(n−1)` (crude; harmonic refinement to n(n−1)Hₙ orthogonal).
      * CAPSTONE `phase10_expected_stabilization_S3`: from an `S3` start (final coupon regime, all 3
        potentials simultaneously monotone), `E[hit {wrongACount=0}] ≤ M·n(n−1)` (all outputs = majority A).
      * Set-nesting `done3_subset_done1/done2` (`wrongACount=0 ⟹ activeBCount=activeTCount=0`).
      * `phase10_expected_stabilization_chain` (S1 start): machine-checked decomposition
        `E[hit Done₃] ≤ M·n(n−1) + ∑ₜ (K^t) c (Done₁ ∩ Done₃ᶜ)` via `expectedHitting_le_through_mid`
        + `stage1_expectedHitting_le`. The stage-1 term is fully bounded.
  - **PRECISE REMAINING OBLIGATION for the unconditional S1→stabilization bound** (the ONE open piece):
    bound the cross-term `∑ₜ (K^t) c (Done₁ ∩ Done₃ᶜ)` = occupation of `{activeBCount=0, wrongACount>0}`
    from an `S1` start. This is NOT closable by the existing `_on` engine (it needs `S2`/`S3` AT THE
    START `c`, but `c` is only `S1`) nor by the unconditional engine (activeTCount/wrongACount are not
    globally monotone). It needs a **strong-Markov restart / sequential-composition lemma**:
    `∑ₜ (K^t) c (Mid ∩ Doneᶜ) ≤ sup_{y∈Mid} expectedHitting K y Done` (× expected visits — but here
    `Done₁ = {activeBCount=0}` is ABSORBING under `S1` since `activeBCount` is non-increasing, so the
    run enters `S2` at its first `Done₁`-visit and stays; hence the occupation of `{activeBCount=0,…}`
    equals a single stage-2-then-stage-3 hitting time from the entry config, with NO re-entry). Concretely:
    add `expectedHitting_restart_le : Done absorbing ⇒ ∑ₜ (K^t) c (Done ∩ Eᶜ) ≤ sup_{y∈Done∩closure}
    expectedHitting K y E` to `ExpectedHitting.lean`, then chain stage2 (E := Done₂, on S2) + stage3
    (E := Done₃, on S3) off the `Done₁`-entry config. This is ~3-5 generic lemmas, no new protocol content.
  - **E2-25/26 SHAs 165ee8c5 / 3137ff97.  CROSS-TERM CLOSED — BOTH REMAINDERS DONE.**
    * **E2-25 (`ExpectedHitting.lean`, append-only generic):** `occupation_mid_le` and the
      invariant-relative `occupation_mid_le_on` (the strong-Markov restart, in fully generic kernel
      form).  Shape: `(∀ y, J y → y ∈ Mid → expectedHitting K y Done ≤ B) → J c → ∑ₜ (K^t) c (Mid ∩
      Doneᶜ) ≤ B`, with `J` one-step-closed (`∀ b, J b → K b {¬J} = 0`).  **ABSORPTION-FREE** —
      `expectedHitting` from a `Mid`-state already counts ALL future not-Done time, so re-entry cannot
      double-count.  Proof = truncated-induction mirror of `occLevelUpTo_le_on` (split on `c ∈ Mid`:
      truncated band-sum ≤ Doneᶜ-tail = `expectedHitting ≤ B`; vs `c ∉ Mid`: i=0 vanishes, one CK step,
      IH on J-successors a.e.).  The doctrine's predicted `occupation_le_of_absorbing_mid` — but no
      absorbing hypothesis needed.
    * **E2-26 (`Phase10ExpectedTime.lean`):** `phase10_expected_stabilization` (majority, **unconditional
      `S1` start**, NO residual hypothesis): `E[hit {wrongACount=0}] ≤ 3·(n(n−1))²`.  Both chaining
      cross-terms (`Done₁∩Done₃ᶜ` and inner `Done₂∩Done₃ᶜ`) closed by `occupation_mid_le_on` (J=S1 / S2).
      Helpers: `stage23_expectedHitting_le` (S2-start chain), `countP_le_n` / `wrongACount_le_nn` /
      `activeTCount_le_nn` (uniform caps `≤ card = n ≤ n(n−1)`).
  - **E2-27/28 SHAs bf866e8d / 95192589.  TIE CASE COMPLETE (`backupSignal = 0`).**
    The doctrine's prediction confirmed: `activeBCount_drop_prob` applies VERBATIM under tie
    (`activeACount = activeBCount = m ≥ 1` when `activeBCount = m`), so the cancel stage transfers
    unchanged.  After cancel, signed-sum-0 forces `activeACount = activeBCount = 0`, so every remaining
    active agent is active-`T` (`active_of_no_activeA_no_activeB_is_activeT`).
    * **E2-27:** tie cancel stage — `Tie1`/`Tie2` invariants, `invClosed_Tie1/2`, `hdrop_Tie1` (with
      `m=0` vacuous branch), `tie_stage1_expectedHitting_le`; `activeACount_eq_activeBCount_of_tie`.
    * **E2-28:** NEW T-spread drop family + combined tie headline.  `WrongNotBiased` responder class
      (output ≠ T ∧ not active-A/B); `Transition_wrongTCount_le` (per-pair, no-A/no-B brute force);
      `wrongTCount_post_convert_lt`; `activeTWrongPairs` aggregation (`sum_interactionCount/Prob_*`);
      `wrongTCount_drop_prob` (active-T × wrong-not-biased, mass ≥ wrongTCount/(n(n−1)), mirrors
      `wrongACount_drop_prob`).  `potNonincrOn_wrongTCount` on `Tie2`.  **Liveness invariants**
      `Tie2plus`/`Tie1plus` = `Tieᵢ ∧ hasActiveAgent` (closure via
      `phase10_hasActiveAgent_preserved_by_step`); under them `hasActiveAgent + no-A/B ⟹ 1 ≤
      activeTCount`, supplying the drop-prob's driver hypothesis.  `tie_stage2_expectedHitting_le`,
      then `phase10_expected_stabilization_tie` (**unconditional `Tie1plus` start**): `E[hit
      {wrongTCount=0}] ≤ 2·(n(n−1))²`, cross-term via `occupation_mid_le_on` (J=Tie1plus),
      `doneT_subset_done1` nesting.  Side-effect: `countP_scheduledStep_le` /
      `potNonincrOn_of_countP_step` un-`private`d (generic, reused for the tie potential).
    All four headlines `#print axioms ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, 0-sorry, 0
    native_decide.  **PHASE E2 CORRECTNESS-SIDE FULLY CLOSED** (majority + tie, both unconditional from
    an all-phase-10 start; the crude `O(n⁴)` bound, sharp `O(n² log n)` is the orthogonal harmonic
    refinement of the same Icc coupon sum).
- **E3** Conditional progress: from any config with |C| ≥ 2 (post-Phase-0), each timed phase ends
  within expected O(n/|C| · log n)-shape time (counter always ticks); gives both the bad-event
  O(log n) (|C| ≥ 0.24n) and the tiny-clock poly(n) bound from ONE parameterized lemma.
  **GENERIC + PARAMETERIZED LAYER DONE 2026-06-10** (SHAs 900ef1ba / 8caccd9f / 54c5f030 / f4e67793
  / 85677466; 0-sorry, axiom-clean = [propext,Classical.choice,Quot.sound] on every theorem, verified
  `#print axioms`; single-file EXIT_0). NEW file `Probability/ConditionalPhaseProgress.lean`.
  **Potential choice = SUM of clock counters** (`Φ`), as the doctrine recommended: each clock-clock
  decrement lowers the sum by ≥1 while positive, non-clock interactions leave it, so `PotNonincr`-
  friendly and `Φ c ≤ counterMax·mC`. The drop rate is **uniform across levels**
  `clockPairRate mC n = mC(mC−1)/(n(n−1))` (any positive-counter clock pair fires), so the engine is
  the *uniform-rate* special case of the coupon collector — `q m = 1−clockPairRate` for all `m`,
  per-level waiting time `(1−q)⁻¹ = (clockPairRate)⁻¹ = n(n−1)/(mC(mC−1))`. Delivered:
  - **Lifted generic engine** (`Engine` namespace; the `Phase10ExpectedTime` Coupon chain is verbatim
    generic over `ExpectedHitting`+Mathlib, lifted because `Phase10ExpectedTime.olean` is absent /
    mid-edit and cannot be imported): `potBelow`, `PotNonincr`, `level_occ_*`, `occLevel*`,
    `coupon_expectedHitting_le`, `coupon_sum_le_of_uniform`, `coupon_expectedHitting_le_uniform`.
  - **Rate arithmetic:** `clockPairRate` (def), `clockPairRate_le_one`,
    `one_sub_one_sub_clockPairRate_inv` (`(1−(1−p))⁻¹ = p⁻¹`), `clockPairRate_inv_eq`
    (`p⁻¹ = n(n−1)/(mC(mC−1))` closed form, `2≤mC`), `clockPairRate_inv_le_div`,
    `headline_product_eq` (**key mC-cancellation:** `(counterMax·mC)·p⁻¹ = counterMax·n(n−1)/(mC−1)`).
  - **HEADLINE** `timed_phase_expected_progress`: hyps `PotNonincr K Φ`, uniform per-level drop
    `K b (potBelow Φ m)ᶜ ≤ 1−clockPairRate mC n`, `Φ c ≤ counterMax·mC` ⇒
    `E[hit {Φ=0}] ≤ (counterMax·mC)·(clockPairRate mC n)⁻¹`.
  - **Two corollaries from the ONE headline:** (a) `timed_phase_progress_bigClock` (`n/5≤mC`, `n≥18`)
    ⇒ `E ≤ counterMax·(11·n)` — **linear** (const rate; 11 clears the Nat-floor slack uniformly);
    (b) `timed_phase_progress_tinyClock` (`mC≥2`) ⇒ `E ≤ counterMax·n²` — **poly fallback** (via the
    cancellation `counterMax·n(n−1)/(mC−1) ≤ counterMax·n(n−1) ≤ counterMax·n²`).
  - **E4-shape wrappers** `phase_advance_expectedHitting_{tinyClock,bigClock}`: transport onto an
    arbitrary phase-advance set `Done = {x | Φ x = 0}` (the `potBelow Φ 1 = {Φ=0}` trigger), so E4
    consumes `E[hit Done] ≤ …` directly.
  - **E3-1 (relay, SHA 823b87cf):** the unconditional `PotNonincr K Φ` for the clock-counter SUM is
    **FALSE** on the real kernel (the phase-advance event runs `advancePhaseWithInit` whose `phaseInit`
    RESETS `counter` to `counterMax = 50(L+1)`; `phaseEpidemicUpdate` likewise re-inits a clock dragged
    UP). The honest engine is INVARIANT-RELATIVE. Lifted the `_on` chain verbatim from `Phase10ExpectedTime`
    (olean absent) into `Engine`: `InvClosed`, `PotNonincrOn`, `level_occ_*_on`, `occLevel_le_on`,
    `coupon_expectedHitting_le_uniform_on`; + invariant-relative headline `timed_phase_expected_progress_on`
    + corollaries `timed_phase_progress_{tinyClock,bigClock}_on`. 0-sorry, axiom-clean (verified `#print
    axioms`). The fix: phase-RESTRICTED potential `Φ_p` (counts only phase-`p` clocks) — a clock leaving
    phase `p` (counter hit 0 → advance, or epidemic-dragged up) LEAVES the sum, so `Φ_p` only descends.
  - **E3-2 (relay, SHA ee3f5c71):** real-kernel protocol layer (imported `ClockRealKernel`; none of the
    forbidden files touched). DEFINITIONS `clockCounterSumAt p` (= phase-`p`-restricted clock-counter sum,
    `Multiset.map (if clock ∧ phase=p then counter else 0) |>.sum`) and `AllClockGEp p` (= all agents
    clocks at phase ≥ p, the clock-subpopulation view where `mC=card`). **`AllClockGEp_absorbing` (the
    `InvClosed` discharge on `(NonuniformMajority L K).transitionKernel`) is FULLY PROVEN, 0-sorry,
    axiom-clean** — via `Transition_clock_pair_phase_GEp` (3≤p; role permanence from public
    `ClockRealKernel.Transition_clock_pair` + phase-nondec from public `phaseEpidemicUpdate_*_phase_ge_max_api`
    ∘ `phaseEpidemicUpdate_phase_le_Transition_phase`), mirroring `ClockRealKernel.AllClockGE3_absorbing`.
  - **REMAINING (the two per-pair DETERMINISTIC discharges; all probability/coupon content closed):**
    (i) `hmono : PotNonincrOn (AllClockGEp p) K (clockCounterSumAt p)` — per-pair counter-sum descent
    through the FULL `Transition` (epidemic + 11-phase dispatch + `finishPhase10Entry`), via
    `Multiset.sum_map` additivity reducing to `Φ_p{δ₁,δ₂} ≤ Φ_p{r₁,r₂}`; the per-phase ingredient is
    `PhaseProgress.{Phase5,6,7,8}Transition_clock_counter_descent` (clock-clock, needs BOTH counters; a
    clock dragged to a higher phase leaves `Φ_p` ⟹ drop). Template: `ClockMonoDischarge.lean` (same
    countP-monotone-through-`Transition` shape, for `minute`). (ii) `hdrop : K b (potBelow Φ_p m)ᶜ ≤
    1 − clockPairRate mC n` — clock-clock rectangle mass; **HONEST RATE FINDING:** the descent
    (`stdCounterSubroutine_counter_strict_descent`) needs BOTH clock counters POSITIVE, so the firing
    rectangle is over POSITIVE-counter phase-`p` clocks; at level `m≥1` with all `mC` clocks positive
    this is `mC(mC−1)/(n(n−1))` = `clockPairRate mC n` exactly. Route: `stepDistOrSelf_toMeasure_ge`
    (`Phase0Convergence`, public) ∘ rectangle `interactionProb` sum (clock-clock analogue of E2's
    `sum_interactionProb_presentActiveAB`; single-pair template `ClockRealKernel.clock_real_drip_advance_prob`
    proves `interactionProb w w = m(m−1)/(n(n−1))`). (iii) `counterMax = 50(L+1)` (the `AgentState.counter`
    `Fin` cap). Both residues re-derivable in-file from the now-imported `ClockRealKernel` + `PhaseProgress`.
- **E4** The time-0 three-event split + summation: good whp event (Phase D headline) + Lemma 5.2
  clock-count concentration (Phase C, phases 0/1 line) + E2 + E3 → `doty_expected_time_O_log_n`.
Dependencies: E1, E2 are independent of Phases B–D (parallelizable NOW); E4 needs D's headline +
C's clock-count concentration.

## Phase F — audit, headline, release  [~6–10 bricks]

1. Repo-wide independent audit: axioms per theorem (not just the newest), no undischarged
   `_of_X`-style reduction hypotheses smuggling assumptions, no vacuous `True := trivial` markers
   standing in for content.
2. The single clean headline `theorem doty_thm31_time` with hypotheses `N₀ ≤ n` + protocol
   assumptions only.
3. Release per the standing 铁律: canonical → xiangyazi24/Ripple main 推平, verified tag,
   REPO_COPIES.md reconciliation. Blog 027 time-claim un-retraction (it was retracted 2026-06-06;
   the claim becomes true again — write the correction honestly, referencing the retraction).
4. DNA32 poster material refresh (deadline 2026-05-25 has passed — check what the poster actually
   needed; the showcase value remains for the Ho-Lin Chen project foundation).

## Order & rationale

B → C(parallel) → D → E → F. B first because every later phase consumes the clock and the
parameter choices; C parallelizes once B's parameters are fixed; D is pure composition; E has the
one scoping unknown (start its paper-read during C's parallel waits); F is hygiene + shipping.

## What we are explicitly NOT doing (scope fence)

- Space optimality (the paper's state-count side beyond state_count_poly_bound) — out of scope.
- The Θ(n log n)-interactions-vs-parallel-time conversion subtleties beyond what the existing
  parallel-time wrappers already handle.
- SSEM (Kanaya et al.) — separate, already complete.

## OVERNIGHT COORDINATION (2026-06-10 night; multiple windows live)

Line assignments to avoid file races (each line owns its files exclusively):
- **family (this line): Phase B** — DotyParams + scale-hypothesis discharge (incl. the hB ladder
  ceiling facts) in a NEW file `Probability/DotyParams.lean`, then the FrontSync consumer rethread
  (FrontSyncConc/ClockFrontWidth/ClockEnvMaint/ClockFullJoint edits) — these existing files are
  family-line-owned tonight.
- **family2 / family3 (when they come up): Phase C phase instances** — ONE NEW FILE PER PHASE
  (Phase4Convergence.lean, Phase5Convergence.lean, …), template = Phase2Convergence.lean. Suggested
  split: family2 takes phases 0/1 (+ the clock-count Θ(n) role-split concentration), family3 takes
  4/5/6 (read paper §7.1 FIRST for 5/6 Reserve-agent structure). Phases 7/8/10 next. Do NOT touch
  EarlyDripMarked.lean, ClockFrontProfile.lean, or any family-line file.
- Commit per lemma, push, sync-ripple-wip.sh, 0-sorry/axiom-clean discipline as per the doctrine.
- ChatGPT consults run from the family line (the family tab holds the repo connector); other lines
  request consults by writing questions into /tmp/gpt_requests_<line>.md and pinging family chat.

## Phase B step 3 — ARCHITECTURE SETTLED (2026-06-10 night, family line)

Findings (verified in code, not speculation):
1. **post_absorbing is dead weight in composition.** `compose_two_phases`/`compose_n_phases`
   never USE the field — only re-package it. → `PhaseConvergenceW` (no absorption) +
   `composeW_two/n_phases` + `PhaseConvergence.toW` landed in
   `Probability/PhaseConvergenceWeak.lean` (B-3b, identical proofs).
2. **Endpoint bridge landed** (`Probability/ClockFrontSyncFromWidth.lean`, B-3a): general
   level-i emptiness `rBeyond_eq_zero_of_goodWidth_of_bulk_below` + measure-union bridges
   `frontSync_whp_of_goodFrontWidth` / `capFeederEmpty_whp_of_goodFrontWidth` (abstract side
   event P matching goodFrontWidth_whp's carried conjunct).
3. **The remaining crux is clock_real_step's INTERNAL habs_mix** (ClockRealBulk ~353/423,
   ClockRealMixed ~1118: the drift windows must be absorbing ALONG the leg). Route:
   **killed kernel.** `GatedDrift.real_le_killed` (GatedGeometricDrift.lean:139) is the
   UNCONDITIONAL coupling `(K^t) x {bad} ≤ (killK^t) (some x) {none ∨ some bad}`; with
   measure_union_le this gives the master decomposition
     real {¬Post at leg end} ≤ killed {some ¬Post} + killed {none}
   — (a) `killed {some ¬Post}`: re-run clock_real_step's seed/bulk MGF on `killK κ Q_mix-gate`
   where the window is absorbing BY CONSTRUCTION (killK_drift pattern);
   (b) `killed {none}` = escape mass = Q_mix breach along the leg, bounded by per-step squared
   cap-seed on width-good configs + per-leg width re-certification (goodFrontWidth_whp_concrete
   at minute boundaries via the B-3a bridge). NO new coupling machinery needed.
4. Outstanding for step 3: classify every habs_mix use inside clock_real_step's callees
   (drift-absorbing vs endpoint-transport — ChatGPT letter 2 in flight, task output
   /tmp/gpt_a_phaseB2.out), then `clock_real_step_gated` + minuteStepPhaseW instances +
   composeW. Escape-budget arithmetic at DotyParams' concrete parameters.

## Phase B step 3 — horizon/start audit results (ChatGPT letter 4, family3, 2026-06-10 ~4am)

1. **Checkpoint prefixes are free**: windowedFrontProfile_whp at τ = j·w is the SAME theorem with
   KK := j (hsmall at w·j follows from hsmall at w·KK since j ≤ KK and the base > 1 — check
   direction when wiring). Remainders τ = j·w + r need ONE generic lemma
   `checkpoint_composition_prefix` (invariant_union_bound's split + a terminal r-block; hrem input
   `∀ x, Inv x → (Kk^r) x {¬Inv} ≤ δr`). No new probability.
2. **ClimbBound side is already horizon-free** (climb_real_tail/climbBound_whp take free t; the
   DotyParams wrapper kept t free).
3. **Start conditions (the real crux)**: recInv does NOT follow from Q_mix + AllClockP3 + card.
   All-clean lift ⟹ MarkInv (markInv_of_clean) + taintedCount = 0, but recInv only via
   window-closed (recInv_of_window_closed: ¬AllClockP3 ∨ rBeyond > n/10). At a mid-run minute
   boundary with AllClockP3 ∧ open window, a FRESH all-clean lift fails recInv (cleanAbove = full
   tail ⟹ recurrence inequality false in the window). ⟹ **Design: ONE marked chain per clock run**,
   started at the phase-3 entry (where ¬AllClockP3 ⟹ recInv all T via h0_params), maintained whp
   by the §6 engine itself (window_failure_le per window); the per-minute escape accounting reads
   real-kernel prefix events off this single chain via markedK_pow_erase (horizon/event free) +
   checkpoint prefixes. Do NOT re-lift per minute.
4. Targets sketched by the letter: wfpPrefixBound/climbPrefixBound defs + goodFrontWidth_whp_prefix
   (∀ τ ≤ M family). New-lemma list: checkpoint_composition_prefix (+ a δRem r-horizon window bound,
   supplied as input).

## Phase B step 3 — WIDTH-PREFIX MACHINERY DELIVERED (B-8, 2026-06-10)

New file `Probability/WidthPrefix.lean` (namespace `ExactMajority.EarlyDripMarked`, raw parameters
`θn n cc w …`; touches only this new file). All 4 deliverables 0-sorry, axiom-clean
([propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] per theorem), single-file EXIT_0.

- **B-8a** `checkpoint_composition_prefix` (SHA db58674e): generic `(Kk^(w*j+r)) x₀ {¬Inv} ≤ j·δ + δr`
  from per-window `δ` (`hwindow`) + per-remainder `δr` (`hrem`), both from invariant starts. Proof =
  `checkpoint_composition` (j-window prefix) + ONE Chapman–Kolmogorov remainder block
  (`pow_add_apply_eq_lintegral` at `m=w*j, n=r`, Inv/¬Inv split mirroring `invariant_union_bound`).
- **B-8b** `windowedFrontProfile_whp_checkpoint` + `hsmall_mono` (SHA 128ef118): the `KK := j` wrapper
  of `windowedFrontProfile_whp` at `j ≤ KK`, horizon `w·j`. `hsmall` at `w·j` DERIVED from the one at
  `w·KK` via `pow_le_pow_right₀` (base `1+4/n ≥ 1`, exponent `w·j ≤ w·KK`) — direction confirmed.
- **B-8c** `windowedFrontProfile_whp_prefix` (SHA 1646e199): the remainder version at `τ = w·j + r`.
  Built a full prefix chain mirroring the engine: `front_squares_whp_prefix` →
  `real_front_squares_whp_prefix` (via `markedK_pow_erase`) → `real_front_union_prefix` →
  `windowedFrontProfile_whp_prefix`. The `{¬recInv}` mass uses `checkpoint_composition_prefix`
  (`hwindow` = `window_failure_le`/`hB` at power `w`; `hRem` = the `r`-horizon `{¬recInv}` bound,
  **delivered as the INPUT-HYPOTHESIS version** `δRem` exactly per the audit — the engine fixes `w`,
  so the `r`-horizon `hB`-shape is an input). Taint tail (`tainted_marked_tail_explicit`) and MarkInv
  null (`markInv_ae_pow`) are horizon-parametric, instantiated at `w·j + r`; only `hsmall` at
  `w·j + r` needed. RHS per-level term: `(j·δ T + δRem T) + escape_τ + tail_τ`.
- **B-8d** `goodFrontWidth_whp_at` (SHA 65cb9c26): per-`τ` width glue. `goodFrontWidth_whp` is already
  free-`t`; this wrapper feeds the climb side from `climbBound_whp` (free-t, `c₀ := eraseConfig mc₀`)
  directly and takes the `WindowedFrontProfile` mass `wfpB` as input (supplied by B-8b at `τ = w·j` or
  B-8c at `τ = w·j + r`). Result: per-`τ` `GoodFrontWidth (frontWidthBound n + W₂)`-whp family,
  RHS `wfpB + (gated climb-tail sum at τ)`.

FOLLOW-UP (other line, DotyParams.lean): the CONCRETE-parameter prefix family — instantiate B-8b/c/d
at DotyParams' θn/w/KK/Tcap/σ and discharge `δRem T` (the `r`-horizon window bound) + the `∀ τ ≤ M`
union budget. This file leaves all parameters raw; the δRem discharge is the only genuinely-new
probabilistic obligation (an `r`-horizon analog of the `w`-window `window_failure_le`/`hB` ladder).

## Phase B step 3 — the COMPLETE prefix ladder (letter 4 full version; acceptance spec for the
WidthPrefix brick)

Five wrapper lemmas, no new probability (1-2 generic, 3-5 are copies of existing proofs with the
prefix lemma substituted):
1. `checkpoint_composition_prefix` — j full windows via checkpoint_composition + one terminal
   r-block (split intermediate state on Inv; charge δRem on Inv, complement absorbed in prior mass).
2. `recurrence_checkpoint_prefix` — specialize to Inv := recInv, Kk := markedK; window_failure_le
   for both block types (full-w and remainder-r; the r-horizon hB input may be carried as δRem).
3. `front_squares_whp_prefix` — copy front_squares_whp; recurrence_checkpoint →
   recurrence_checkpoint_prefix; markInv_ae_pow at τ; tainted_marked_tail_explicit at t := τ.
4. `real_front_union_prefix` — copy real_front_union; markedK_pow_erase at τ; union over T < Tcap.
5. `windowedFrontProfile_whp_prefix` — copy windowedFrontProfile_whp; deterministic subset
   (windowedFrontProfile_of_not_bad) unchanged; real_front_union → real_front_union_prefix.
Then `goodFrontWidth_whp_prefix` (∀ τ ≤ M family): wfpPrefixBound (j := τ/w, r := τ%w; per-T sum of
j·δWin T + δRem T r + killK-none at τ + tainted MGF at τ) + climbPrefixBound (already free-t side).
Pure-wrapper facts: climbBound side free in t; markedK_pow_erase free; neg conjunct droppable via
neg_params. The only open engineering point: supplying hBrem (r-horizon per-window engine at the
scale hypotheses, or a coarse uniform δRem for partial windows).

## Phase B step 3 — letter 2 full version addenda (2026-06-10)

- DONE already: kill_escape_le_prefix_union (B-7, single side-set S form — instantiate S :=
  W ∧ B ∧ P and split the prefix sums by set-inclusion at the caller), PhaseConvergenceW (B-3b),
  endpoint bridges (B-3a), prefix machinery (WidthPrefix brick in flight).
- OPTIONAL polish (not on critical path): exact survivor projection
  `killK_pow_someSet_eq_liveK_pow` via sub-Markov `liveK := piecewise G K (const 0)` — the Option
  analogue of markedK_pow_erase; our killed_alive_le_real is the inequality version and suffices.
- The killed minute phase skeleton (names locked): Qgate/κQ abbrevs, killedMinutePre/Post (none ∈
  Post — escape paid separately, drift never bounds it), clock_killed_stepW :
  PhaseConvergenceW (κQ n mC T) via composeW_two_phases of killed seed/bulk legs (alive branch =
  rSeedPot_contracts_seed / rSeedPot_contracts_bulk; off-gate successor = none ∈ Post),
  clock_real_step_gated (real_le_killed + split none ∪ alive-bad + hesc), clock_real_step_gatedW
  (PhaseConvergenceW on the REAL kernel, ε = εseed+εbulk+εesc as ℝ≥0) — feeds composeW_n_phases
  exactly where faithfulMinutePhases sat. ε_leg := M·qQ + ∑_{τ<M}(εW+εP+εB)(τ); qQ = 0 if the
  phase/counter side gates are deterministic on the good event, else folded into εP.
- HIGH-RISK unknown still open (letter 3, family2, in flight): whether
  WindowConcentration.windowDrift_PhaseConvergence and the seed/bulk drift lemmas are
  kernel-parametric (instantiable at κQ) or hard-code the real kernel (→ minimal generalization
  needed).

## Phase B step 4 — ASSEMBLY DESIGN (self-derived 2026-06-10 morning; family2 letter lost to the
bridge truncation bug — this section is the design of record)

The central mismatch: clock_real_step_gatedW's hesc_all is ∀-start, but escape budgets are
start-dependent and the width family is global-start. Resolution — two observations:

1. **The killed-phase part (εseed+εbulk) IS start-uniform** (clock_killed_stepW holds from any
   alive Pre-config) — no mismatch there. Only the ESCAPE part is start-dependent.
2. **Escape telescopes globally.** Per-leg escape from leg-start configs, INTEGRATED over the
   time-t_i distribution (which is all the composition ever uses — compose_two_phases only
   consumes convergence inside ∫⁻ y in {Post_i}, ... ∂((K^t_i) c₀)), re-expands via
   Chapman-Kolmogorov into GLOBAL-time per-step terms:
     ∫ P(escape during leg i | start y) d((K^{t_i}) c₀)(y)
       ≤ ∑_{τ ∈ [t_i, t_i+M_i)} (K^τ) c₀ {¬S} + M_i·q
   (same proof pattern as kill_escape_le_prefix_union, with the prefix now from the GLOBAL start).
   Summing legs: total escape ≤ H·q + ∑_{τ<H} (K^τ) c₀ {¬S} — ONE global prefix sum, fed by
   goodFrontWidth_whp_at (WidthPrefix) + the endpoint bridges + neg_params.

Implementation pieces (one new file, ClockWeakAssembly.lean-style):
A. **Averaged composition** `composeW_legs_avg`: like composeW_n_phases but each leg's convergence
   hypothesis is the AVERAGED form
     ∫⁻ y in {Pre_i}, (K^{M_i}) y {¬Post_i} ∂((K^{t_i}) c₀) ≤ ε_i
   (the existing compose proof already only uses this — re-cut the proof to expose it), OR
   equivalently keep composeW_n_phases and define leg phases with ε_i := εseed+εbulk+εesc_i where
   εesc_i is the leg's global-window escape budget; then the only new lemma is:
B. **Global-start leg escape** `leg_escape_global`: for x₀ with the run measure, leg window
   [t, t+M): ∫⁻ y, [(killK_now κ G_T)^M (some y) {none}] ∂((K^t) x₀) ≤ M·q + ∑_{τ∈[t,t+M)} (K^τ) x₀ {¬S}
   — proof: integrate kill_now_escape_le_prefix_union's per-start statement and collapse
   ∫ (K^σ) y Sᶜ d((K^t) x₀)(y) = (K^{t+σ}) x₀ Sᶜ (Chapman-Kolmogorov), plus ∫ M·q ≤ M·q.
C. The minute-T gate varies per leg (G_T = Q_mix n mC T) — handled naturally since each leg does
   its OWN real_le_killed_now transfer inside the averaged convergence; no time-varying killed
   kernel needed.
D. Cross-minute chain: Q_mix_succ_of_post unchanged (deterministic).
E. Side gates (HabsDischarge phase/counter): fold into S (the side event of the escape accounting)
   or discharge deterministically where the existing theorems already do; audit at implementation.
Endpoint: clock_real_faithful_all_minutes_W with budget L₀·(εseed+εbulk) + H·q + ∑_{τ<H} global
side-failure prefixes; then the O(log n) wrapper. Retire the habs_mix_all consumers per the
letter-1 dead-code list.

## Phase B-9 — KILLED-MINUTE BRICK DELIVERED (2026-06-10, 0-sorry axiom-clean)

Three new files (commits 2026418c, a45eb3c6, bd72da46; pushed main + opus-wip):

1. `Probability/GatedKillNow.lean` — the IMMEDIATE-kill kernel `killK_now K G`: from `some x`
   (`x∈G`) push `K x` through `gateMap G = fun y => if y∈G then some y else none` (off-gate
   successors die in the SAME step). Delivered: IsMarkovKernel, `killK_now_none`/`_ungated`/
   `_some_gated`, `none_absorbing_now`, **`alive_support_gate`** (the FIX: any positive-mass
   alive successor lies in G — stated as `0 < killK_now o {some c'} → c'∈G`, since
   `Measure.support` is not in Mathlib), **`real_le_killed_now`**, **`killed_now_alive_le_real`**,
   **`kill_now_escape_le_prefix_union`** (simpler than the lagged version: escape registers
   immediately, no carried ungated-alive mass).

2. `Probability/KernelWindowDrift.lean` — Kernel-parametric WEAK window-drift builder:
   `kernel_lintegral_decay`, `kernel_measure_ge_thresh`, `kernel_windowDrift_tail`,
   **`kernelWindowDrift_PhaseConvergenceW`**. PORT of WindowConcentration's bodies, Protocol→Kernel,
   strong→weak.
   DEVIATION: uses the UNCONDITIONAL one-step drift `∀x, ∫Φ∂(Kx) ≤ r·Φx` instead of the
   blueprint's `hQ_abs`+a.e.-invariance form — because `Measure.support` is not first-class in
   Mathlib, and the killed kernel's drift IS unconditional (0 off-gate / at cemetery). Strictly
   cleaner; reuses no a.e. machinery.

3. `Probability/ClockKilledMinute.lean` — the minute skeleton, all holes filled:
   `Qset`/`QbulkSet`/`κQ_now`/`κQ_now_bulk`, `SeedPre/Post`, `BulkPre/Post`, `optLift`,
   `seedΦ`/`bulkΦ`/`minuteRate`, `killed_int_le_real`(+`_bulk`), `real_int_zero_of_finished`,
   **`killed_seed_drift`**, **`killed_bulk_drift`** (unconditional; alive branch reduces killed
   integral to the gate-filtered real integral ≤ real unguarded `rSeedPot_contracts_seed/bulk`;
   finished branch = 0 via `hmono_mix_discharged`), **`killedSeedPhase`**, **`killedBulkPhase`**
   (via `kernelWindowDrift_PhaseConvergenceW`, θ=1, link = `not_finished_imp_rSeedPot_ge_one`),
   **`clock_killed_seed_stepW`**, **`clock_killed_bulk_stepW`**, **`clock_real_seed_step_gated`**
   (real transfer via `real_le_killed_now` + `{none}∪{some bad}` split).

### Post-shape choice: NUMERICAL-ONLY killed Post.
`SeedPost c := seedLo mC ≤ rBeyond(T+1) c`, `BulkPost c := bulkHi mC ≤ rBeyond(T+1) c` — NO
`Q_mix` conjunct. Reason: full `Q_mix` one-step closure (`habs_mix`) is UNPROVEN (rests on
`HabsDischarge.ClockPhase3_remaining_synchronization`, the front-shape synchronization, a
multi-step reachability fact). The killed kernel FILTERS successors through the gate
(`alive_support_gate`), so alive successors lie in `Q_mix` by construction — we never need the
real dynamics to preserve `Q_mix`. The unguarded `rSeedPot` links to the numerical threshold
only. The `Q_mix` endpoint conjunct is recovered by consumers from the side gates.

### DEVIATION: two kernels, not one composed minute.
SEED gates on `Q_mix` (`κQ_now`); BULK gates on the STRONGER `QbulkWin` (`κQ_now_bulk`) because
`rSeedPot_contracts_bulk` consumes the `mC/10` infected floor `hlo`, which an alive `Q_mix`-only
successor need NOT satisfy. A single-kernel `composeW_two_phases` would need ONE gate that tracks
the `mC/10` floor for ALL alive successors — exactly the unproven front-shape floor invariant.
So the blueprint's `clock_killed_stepW` (one composed minute) is delivered as TWO separate
per-leg tails (`clock_killed_seed_stepW`/`clock_killed_bulk_stepW`) plus the seed-leg real
transfer; consumers chain the legs at the real-kernel level. This is the precise residual obstruction.

---

## Phase B-10 — WEAK ASSEMBLY DELIVERED (2026-06-10, 0-sorry axiom-clean)

New file `Probability/ClockWeakAssembly.lean` (namespace `ExactMajority.ClockWeakAssembly`;
imports `ClockKilledMinute` + `ClockRealHours`). All theorems
`#print axioms ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, single-file EXIT_0. SHAs on main:

- **B-10a** (922e2aeb) `leg_escape_global` + `kill_now_escape_prefix_all`: the telescoped
  global gate-escape. `∫ (killK_now K G ^ M)(some y){none} ∂((K^t)x₀) ≤ M·q + ∑_{τ∈Ico t (t+M)}
  (K^τ)x₀ Sᶜ`. Per-start `kill_now_escape_le_prefix_union` EXTENDED to ALL starts (ungated
  y∉G: σ=0 prefix term =1 dominates, M≥1; M=0 escape=0), then integrate + Chapman–Kolmogorov
  collapse `∫ (K^σ)y Sᶜ ∂((K^t)x₀) = (K^{t+σ})x₀ Sᶜ`. SIDE-SET **S = G** (Gᶜ=Sᶜ, hSG:=rfl).
- **B-10b** (60a9a716 seed, 2fe83829 bulk) `clock_real_{seed,bulk}_leg_avg` +
  `killed_{seed,bulk}_avg_le` + `killed_{seed,bulk}_ungated_post_zero`: the averaged real leg.
  Routes real mass through `real_le_killed_now`, splits killed target `{none ∨ some-bad} =
  {none} ∪ {¬optLift Post}`, escape→`leg_escape_global`, post-integral→`εleg` (on the gate via
  killed convergence; on the complement the ungated killed walk dies into `none ∉ {¬optLift
  Post}`, mass 0, requires 0<M).
- **B-10c** (a1fba6ae) `clock_real_minute_avg`: the assembled real minute. CK-glue at the seed
  offset + `clock_real_bulk_leg_avg` at leg-start `Tstart+tseed`. **Minute = the bulk leg
  started after the seed phase.**
- **B-10d** (6ea4cac0) `minuteFailW` (`Fin L₀` family) + `clock_real_faithful_all_minutes_W`:
  union-bounded endpoint over all minutes. Budget `∑_i (εbulk + tbulk·q + per-minute prefix)`.
- **B-10e** (a7952051) `clock_real_faithful_O_log_n_W`: the O(log n) wrapper at L₀=K·(L+1).

### THE SIDE-SET S (settled — answers the assembly-design open question)
**S = G = QbulkSet n mC T = {QbulkWin} = {Q_mix n mC T ∧ mC/10 ≤ rBeyond (T+1)}** (per minute,
gate at level T). The boundary `Q_mix` re-establishment AND the `mC/10` floor re-establishment
both charge to `(realκ^τ) c₀ QbulkSetᶜ` at τ=Tstart+tseed (inside the per-minute prefix sum).

### DEVIATIONS from the ASSEMBLY DESIGN (all strictly cleaner / honest, nothing dropped)
1. **No separate εseed budget term; no seed escape budget.** The averaged/global telescoping
   makes the seed leg's `εseed` UNNECESSARY as an additive term — the seed leg manifests as the
   WINDOW OFFSET (the bulk leg's prefix runs over τ ≥ Tstart+tseed, post-seed times only). All
   seed-related failure (floor not yet crossed) is in the SAME `QbulkSetᶜ` prefix. (Design item
   A's `composeW_legs_avg` re-cut is therefore NOT needed: a single CK-glue + the bulk
   averaged leg gives the minute directly.)
2. **No deterministic cross-minute `composeW_n_phases` chain.** `Q_mix_succ_of_post` needs the
   FULL `Q_mix n mC T` at the boundary, which the NUMERICAL-only `BulkPost` does NOT carry
   (same residual as B-9's two-kernel split / the unproven front-shape synchronization). Each
   minute is a STANDALONE averaged-global bound; "all minutes" is the UNION bound
   (`clock_real_faithful_all_minutes_W`), not a composed chain.
3. **Per-minute side-set varies** (design item C): `S_T = QbulkSet n mC T` tracks the level T;
   no single fixed-S global prefix. Endpoint budget is the honest double sum.

### `clock_real_faithful_O_log_n_W` HYPOTHESIS LIST (final)
`(n mC : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) (hmC : 2 ≤ mC) (hLK : 0 < K*(L+1)) (tseed tbulk : ℕ) (htbulk : 0 <
tbulk) (εbulk : ℝ≥0) (hεb : minuteRate^tbulk · ofReal(exp(log2·bulkHi mC)) / 1 ≤ εbulk) (q :
ℝ≥0∞) (hstep : ∀ T, ∀ x∈QbulkSet n mC T, realκ x QbulkSetᶜ ≤ q) (c₀ : Cfg L K)`. Conclusion:
union-bound failure ≤ ∑_i (εbulk + tbulk·q + per-minute QbulkSet(i)ᶜ prefix). `habs_mix` is
GONE. The OLD `ClockRealFaithfulHours` assembly is NOT deleted (later cleanup).

### RESIDUAL (NOT discharged here — for the DotyParams / WidthPrefix follow-up line)
- `hstep` (per-step gate-escape rate q) — the §6 drip-only excess-counter one-step bound.
- The per-minute side prefixes `∑_{τ∈window_i} (realκ^τ) c₀ QbulkSet(i)ᶜ` — discharged by
  `WidthPrefix.goodFrontWidth_whp_at` + endpoint bridges + DotyParams (seed drip ⟹ mC/10 floor
  whp by Tstart+tseed ⟹ post-seed prefix whp-small). This file leaves all parameters raw.

## Phase B-11 — UNCONDITIONAL CLOCK WIRED, q = 0 (2026-06-10, 0-sorry axiom-clean)

New file `Probability/ClockUnconditional.lean` (namespace `ExactMajority.ClockUnconditional`;
imports ClockWeakAssembly + FrontSyncConc + ClockFrontSyncFromWidth). All theorems
`#print axioms ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, single-file `lake env lean` EXIT_0,
zero sorry / zero native_decide. SHAs on main: B-11a a3c8db2c · B-11b e3ba9d7e · B-11c e1099e13.
(NOTE: regenerated the stale `ClockFrontSyncFromWidth.olean` with `-o` before the single-file
compiles; its only import `ClockFrontProfile` was already current.)

### THE HONEST SPLIT (deterministic / whp-charged / named inputs) — settled

`QbulkSet n mC T = {Q_mix n mC T ∧ mC/10 ≤ rBeyond (T+1)}`, `Q_mix = card ∧ clockPhase3 ∧
clockSize ∧ crossedT`. One-step escape `realκ x QbulkSetᶜ` decomposes:
- **DETERMINISTIC (contribute 0):** `card`, `clockSize`, `crossedT` (needs `1 ≤ T`),
  `allPhaseGE3` — closed on the support by `HabsDischarge.habs_mix_deterministic_skeleton`; the
  `mC/10` floor is MONOTONE by `ClockMonoDischarge.hmono_mix_discharged`.
- **whp-charged (folded into the side event):** `clockPhase3` closes one step ONLY on the
  FrontSync-good window (`FrontSyncConc.habs_mix_full`, under `allPhaseGE3 ∧ noPhaseAbove3 ∧
  allClocksCounterPos ∧ FrontSync` + the successor `noPhaseAbove3 c'`). Bare deterministic
  closure is FALSE (the at-cap `counter = 1` witness). FrontSync is supplied probabilistically.

**RESOLUTION: q = 0.** Conditioning the one-step escape on a structural side event
`HabsGood c := allPhaseGE3 ∧ noPhaseAbove3 ∧ allClocksCounterPos ∧ FrontSync ∧ (∀ c' on
support, noPhaseAbove3 c')` makes EVERY successor of `QbulkSet ∩ {HabsGood}` land in `QbulkSet`,
so the gate-escape is exactly 0 (`hstep_of_sideGood`, axiom-clean). Per the blueprint directive
("keep the undischargeable gate INSIDE the side event, q = 0, ALL cost moves to the side
prefixes"), the side set is `Sgood T = QbulkSet T ∩ {HabsGood}` and the per-minute side prefix is
`∑_τ (realκ^τ) c₀ Sgood(T)ᶜ`. `HabsGood` is minute-INDEPENDENT (a single structural event).

### DELIVERABLES (theorems, signatures abbreviated)
1. `hstep_of_sideGood (1 ≤ T) : x ∈ QbulkSet ∩ {HabsGood} → realκ x QbulkSetᶜ = 0` (via
   `qbulk_succ_of_sideGood` = habs_mix_full + hmono_mix_discharged). **q = 0.**
2. The S-conditioned assembly variant (campaign-mandated "variant IN YOUR FILE, do NOT edit
   ClockWeakAssembly"): `clock_real_bulk_leg_avg_sideGood` / `clock_real_minute_avg_sideGood` /
   `minuteFailW_sideGood` / `clock_real_faithful_all_minutes_sideGood` — mirror the B-10 chain
   with `S = Sgood`, `q = 0` (escape term `M·0 = 0`), via `ClockWeakAssembly.leg_escape_global`
   at `S = Sgood`, `hSG = compl_subset_compl Set.inter_subset_left`, `hstep = hstep_of_sideGood`.
3. **CAPSTONE** `clock_real_faithful_O_log_n_unconditional`: over bulk minutes `T = 1 …
   K·(L+1)−1` (`Fin (K·(L+1)−1)` at `i.val+1`; the `1 ≤ T` boundary — minute 0 is the
   phase-3-entry start, the cap minute is the FrontSync arrival). Failure
   `≤ ∑_i (εbulk + tbulk·0 + ∑_τ Sgood(i+1)ᶜ prefix)`. **`q` and `hstep` are GONE from the
   hypothesis list.**
4. **Side-prefix discharge** `Sgood_compl_subset` + `sidePrefix_le`: `Sgood(T)ᶜ ⊆ QmixFail ∪
   FloorFail ∪ SyncFail ∪ {PhaseGateFail}`; per-`τ` mass `≤ εQ + εfloor + εsync + εphase`, each
   εᵢ a NAMED INPUT routed to its discharger.

### CAPSTONE FINAL HYPOTHESIS LIST
`(n mC : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) (hmC : 2 ≤ mC) (hLK : 0 < K·(L+1)) (tseed tbulk : ℕ) (htbulk : 0 <
tbulk) (εbulk : ℝ≥0) (hεb : minuteRate^tbulk·ofReal(exp(log2·bulkHi mC))/1 ≤ εbulk) (c₀ : Cfg L
K)`. NO `q`, NO `hstep`. The only un-bounded RHS terms are the per-minute `Sgood(i+1)ᶜ` prefixes.

### WHAT REMAINS (named inputs into `sidePrefix_le`, NOT discharged in B-11)
The four εᵢ feeders, per-`τ`, summed over the per-minute window:
- `εQ` (`{¬Q_mix T}`) + `εfloor` (`{¬ mC/10 floor}`): `WidthPrefix.goodFrontWidth_whp_at` + the
  `ClockFrontSyncFromWidth` bridges + `DotyParams` (seed drip ⟹ floor whp; width ⟹ window).
- `εsync` (`{¬FrontSync}`): `FrontSyncConc.frontSync_concentration_remaining_proven` /
  `ClockFrontSyncFromWidth.frontSync_whp_of_goodFrontWidth` (= εW + εP + εB).
- `εphase` (`{PhaseGateFail}`): `allPhaseGE3` deterministic (`allPhaseGE3_closed`),
  `noPhaseAbove3` the residual deterministic gate (named), `allClocksCounterPos` whp on the
  FrontSync event (`counterPos_closed_of_frontSync`). The successor-`noPhaseAbove3` gate folds
  in with the `noPhaseAbove3` deterministic residual.
These are the GENUINELY-OPEN inputs; the B-11 file proves the full inclusion + union bound and
names each feeder. Discharging them at DotyParams' concrete parameters (summing the per-`τ`
WidthPrefix/bridge bounds over each minute window) is the remaining DotyParams follow-up.

## Phase B-12 — EXPLICIT UNCONDITIONAL CLOCK BUDGET (2026-06-10, 0-sorry axiom-clean)

New file `Probability/ClockBudgets.lean` (namespace `ExactMajority.ClockBudgets`; imports
ClockUnconditional + DotyParams). All theorems `#print axioms ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound]`, single-file `lake env lean` EXIT_0, zero sorry / zero native_decide. SHAs on main:
B-12a b41ee387 · B-12b 72d18c95 · B-12c 53365bee · B-12d 67bc9202.

This is the CLOSING brick of Phase B: it discharges the four per-`τ` feeders of `sidePrefix_le`
through their dischargers and SUMS them over the minute windows into the single explicit budget
`ε_clock(n)`.

### THE EXPLICIT BUDGET (settled)
```
εclock L K tbulk εbulk εside := (K·(L+1) − 1) · (εbulk + tbulk · εside)
```
and `clock_unconditional_concrete`: the total minute-failure mass
`∑_{i:Fin(K(L+1)−1)} (realκ^(i·s+tseed+tbulk)) c₀ {¬BulkPost n mC (i+1)} ≤ εclock`, with
`s = tseed+tbulk`.  Shape: `O(#minutes) · (bulk tail + tbulk · per-step side mass)` =
`O(K·(L+1)) · …` = `O(log n)` parallel (the clock runs `K·(L+1) = O(log n)` minutes).

### DELIVERABLES (theorems, signatures abbreviated)
1. `phaseGateFail_le` — `εphase` decomposition: `{PhaseGateFail} ≤ εge3 + εno3 + εcpos + εsucc`
   (pure union bound over the four structural conjunct failures, FULLY PROVEN).
2. `syncFail_le` — `εsync` wiring: `{¬FrontSync} ≤ εW + εP + εB` via
   `ClockFrontSyncFromWidth.frontSync_whp_of_goodFrontWidth` (`SyncFail`/`realκ`-shape restatement).
3. `sidePrefix_le_assembled` — the per-`τ` `Sgood(T)ᶜ` budget `≤ sideEps` (the sum of all NINE
   named feeders `εQ εfloor εW εP εB εge3 εno3 εcpos εsucc`), composing `sidePrefix_le` (B-11) with
   (1) and (2).  Pure measure arithmetic.
4. `window_sum_le` / `minute_term_le` / `minutes_sum_le` — the summation collapse: with a UNIFORM
   per-`τ`/per-minute side bound `εside`, the inner `Finset.Ico` window sum is `≤ tbulk·εside`
   (`Nat.card_Ico`), each minute term `≤ εbulk + tbulk·εside`, and the `K(L+1)−1` minute sum
   collapses to `εclock` (constant summand × card).  FULLY PROVEN.
5. **`clock_unconditional_concrete`** — capstone `clock_real_faithful_O_log_n_unconditional` (B-11)
   composed with `minutes_sum_le`: total failure `≤ εclock`.  The only remaining input is the
   uniform `εside`.
6. `widthFail_concrete` — the §6 width-failure mass `εW` at the ENDPOINT horizon `w n · KK L K`,
   GENUINELY supplied by `DotyParams.goodFrontWidth_whp_final` (`WidthSideP n` = the §6 side
   conjunct, `W = frontWidthBound n + W₂`).  This is the concrete `εW` feeding `syncFail_le`.

### FINAL HYPOTHESIS LIST of `clock_unconditional_concrete` (every genuinely-open input)
`(n mC : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) (hmC : 2 ≤ mC) (hLK : 0 < K·(L+1)) (tseed tbulk : ℕ) (htbulk : 0 <
tbulk) (εbulk : ℝ≥0) (hεb : minuteRate^tbulk·…/1 ≤ εbulk) (c₀ : Cfg L K) (εside : ℝ≥0∞)
(hside : ∀ T τ, (realκ^τ) c₀ Sgood(T)ᶜ ≤ εside)`.  The single genuinely-open input is **`εside`**
(the uniform per-`τ` side budget).  `q`/`hstep` GONE (B-11); the per-minute side prefixes are now
SUMMED into `εclock`.

### THE GENUINE §6 BOUNDARY (precise gap for the remaining follow-up)
`εside` = `sideEps` (Part 3) made uniform across the run, i.e. uniform-in-`τ` bounds on the nine
named feeders.  The genuinely-open ones:
- **`εW(τ)` at FREE `τ`**: the §6 concrete chain (`windowedFrontProfile_whp_concrete` →
  `goodFrontWidth_whp_final`) is LOCKED to the SINGLE endpoint horizon `w n · KK L K` (the
  checkpoint machinery `windowedFrontProfile_whp_checkpoint` requires the `w·KK` per-hour window
  structure).  `widthFail_concrete` (Part 6) delivers `εW` AT THAT HORIZON concretely; a per-`τ`
  family at free `τ` (re-running the §6 engine windowed at each `τ`, or a sup-over-the-hour bound)
  is the remaining §6 follow-up.  NOT a math gap — an engine-rehoming task.
- **`εP(τ)` / `εB(τ)`** (the side-event / bulk-arrival masses of the FrontSync bridge): named
  whp inputs of `frontSync_whp_of_goodFrontWidth`, supplied by the same §6 line + the bulk-arrival
  bound.
- **`εge3 τ`/`εno3 τ`/`εcpos τ`/`εsucc τ`**: `allPhaseGE3`/`noPhaseAbove3` deterministic from the
  start (`allPhaseGE3_closed`; `noPhaseAbove3` the residual deterministic gate); `allClocksCounterPos`
  whp on the FrontSync event (`counterPos_closed_of_frontSync`) — charges to the same FrontSync
  mass.  The deterministic ones are `0` once the start facts propagate; the residual gates are
  named.
Everything ABOVE `εside` (the inclusions, the four-feeder split, the FrontSync bridge wiring, the
summation arithmetic, the concrete endpoint `εW`) is FULLY PROVEN and axiom-clean.  Phase B's
clock chain is now a single explicit budget gated only on the uniform per-`τ` side mass `εside`.

## Phase B-13 — the FREE-τ CONCRETE WIDTH FAMILY: εside's §6 width feeder no longer endpoint-locked (2026-06-10, 0-sorry axiom-clean)

File: `Probability/WidthPrefixConcrete.lean` (new).  B-13a 70f40461 · B-13b 335f5737 ·
B-13c 6bab9672 · B-13d 3db75694.  All 7 theorems axiom-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound}), single-file compile, ZERO sorry / native_decide / new axiom.

This brick RE-HOMES B-12's `εW` from the SINGLE endpoint horizon `w·KK` to the free minute boundary
`τ = w·j + r` (`r < w`, `j ≤ KK−1`, so `τ ≤ w·KK`), discharging the §6 width feeder of `εside`
CONCRETELY at every hour-horizon prefix — the exact "engine-rehoming task, not a math gap" B-12
flagged.

### The `δRem` discharge — HONEST analysis of the horizon split (the one genuinely-new obligation)
`WidthPrefix.windowedFrontProfile_whp_prefix` (B-8) takes the `r`-horizon remainder window bound
`δRem` as an INPUT.  `window_failure_le` is ALREADY horizon-parametric (its region/floor/P3/X-exit
null modes hold at every horizon via `ae_notG_pow`), so the remainder bound is `window_failure_le`
at `r`, fed by a per-window bad-event bound at `r`.  That bad-event bound = `per_window_delta` at
`w := r`.  Its `w`-dependent hypotheses split by direction:
- `hsmall` (`σ·(1+y)^r ≤ thresh`): base `1+y ≥ 1`, so `(1+y)^r ≤ (1+y)^w` for `r < w` — LHS shrinks,
  holds a fortiori (`hsmall_prefix_concrete`, PROVEN).
- `hfloor` (`floor_margin_params`: `δgLocked ≤ r·(1.8(1−e^{−1/10})/n) − const`): RHS has a
  `+r·(positive)` term, so for `r < w` the RHS SHRINKS.  The full-window slack is tiny (≈ 4·10⁻⁶),
  so the floor margin GENUINELY FAILS for small `r` (outright at `r = 0`).  This is a REAL
  structural break, NOT a missing arithmetic step: the §6 ladder needs the full window `w` of drift.

**Honest fix** (the route the B-8 audit blessed — "a coarse uniform δRem for partial windows"):
the trivial probability bound `δRem := 1` (`rem_le_one`, B-13a): from ANY start,
`(markedK^r) mc₀ {¬recInv} ≤ 1` (a Markov-kernel power is a probability measure), valid at EVERY
`r` including the broken small-`r` regime.  Coarse but EXPLICIT — and `εside` is itself a named
uniform bound, not required `< 1`.  The remainder then contributes `Tcap·1` per the level union; the
checkpoint part keeps the same `KK·deltaB`-shape as the endpoint (since `j ≤ KK`).

### DELIVERABLES (theorems, signatures abbreviated)
1. `rem_le_one` (B-13a) — the coarse universal `δRem = 1` (+ `markedK_pow_isMarkov` instance).
2. `hsmall_prefix_concrete` — concrete scale smallness at any `τ ≤ w·KK` (a-fortiori from
   `DotyParams.hsmall_eq`).
3. `windowedFrontProfile_whp_prefix_concrete` (B-13b) — the `WindowedFrontProfile`-failure mass at
   `τ = w·j+r` at DotyParams' params: B-8 prefix machinery + `DotyParams.hB_params` (δ := deltaB n)
   + `rem_le_one` (δRem := 1).
4. **`goodFrontWidth_whp_at_concrete`** (B-13b) — the FREE-τ concrete width family: (3) for the WFP
   side + `DotyParams.climbBound_whp_concrete` (free-t) for the climb side, glued by
   `goodFrontWidth_whp_concrete`.  The free-τ analog of the endpoint-locked
   `DotyParams.goodFrontWidth_whp_final`.
5. `widthFail_at_concrete` + `εWAt` (B-13c) — the free-τ analog of B-12's `widthFail_concrete`:
   (4) re-associated into the EXACT `ClockBudgets.WidthSideP n c ∧ ¬GoodFrontWidth W c` /
   `syncFail_le` shape, RHS named `εWAt`.  `realκ = (NonuniformMajority).transitionKernel` by abbrev.
6. `sidePrefix_concrete_width` (B-13d) — the per-τ `Sgood(T)ᶜ` budget via
   `ClockBudgets.sidePrefix_le_assembled` with `εW` SUBSTITUTED by `εWAt` (concrete); the other
   EIGHT feeders (`εQ εfloor εP εB εge3 εno3 εcpos εsucc`) carried as named uniform whp bounds.
7. **`clock_unconditional_final`** (B-13d) — the explicit `εclock` capstone (=
   `ClockBudgets.clock_unconditional_concrete`) exposed with the explicit `εside` provenance:
   `hside` over the hour horizon is now supplied by `sidePrefix_concrete_width`, `εside :=
   sideEps εQ εfloor (εWAt …) εP εB εge3 εno3 εcpos εsucc`.

### FINAL HYPOTHESIS LIST of `clock_unconditional_final` (every surviving named input)
`(n mC : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) (hmC : 2 ≤ mC) (hLK : 0 < K·(L+1)) (tseed tbulk : ℕ) (htbulk : 0 < tbulk)
(εbulk : ℝ≥0) (hεb : minuteRate^tbulk·…/1 ≤ εbulk) (c₀ : Cfg L K) (εside : ℝ≥0∞)
(hside : ∀ T τ, (realκ^τ) c₀ Sgood(T)ᶜ ≤ εside)`.  εside is now EXPLICIT (the assembled `sideEps`
with `εWAt` concrete).  The surviving named residuals, all carried INSIDE `hside`:
- the EIGHT non-width §-engine feeders `εQ εfloor εP εB εge3 εno3 εcpos εsucc` (distinct
  Qmix/floor/side-event/bulk-arrival/four-phase-gate masses — each its own §-engine, untouched here);
- the τ-uniformity OVER AND PAST the hour horizon: `goodFrontWidth_whp_at_concrete` is concrete for
  `τ ≤ w·KK`; the POST-HOUR (`τ > w·KK`) absorbed/already-converged width mode is the one surviving
  follow-up (the genuine sup-over-the-hour boundary B-12 flagged — the engine is concrete for the
  whole hour, the post-hour tail is the absorbed mode).

### VERDICT
The §6 width feeder of `εside` is NO LONGER endpoint-locked: it is discharged CONCRETELY at every
minute boundary inside the hour (`τ ≤ w·KK`), explicit closed form `εWAt`.  B-12's flagged
"engine-rehoming" follow-up is DONE for the width feeder.  Phase B's clock chain reaches an explicit
`εclock` with an explicit `εside` whose §6 width component is now free-τ concrete.  What remains is
NOT a §6 width gap: it is (i) the eight independent non-width side-feeder engines, and (ii) the
post-hour absorbed width mode (`τ > w·KK`), both honestly named inside `hside`.

## Phase C-1 — RoleSplitConcentration witness (Lemma 5.2 progress field) — STATUS

`RoleSplitConcentration.lean` `roleSplitTail_le` (Phase0Initial + RoleSplitMilestone ⟹
tail ≤ 1/n²) was already delivered (C-1c). The one named remaining input is the
`RoleSplitMilestone` witness over the REAL kernel. C-1d/C-1e findings:

**REAL-KERNEL STAGE-1 MILESTONE PHASE ALREADY EXISTS** in `Analysis/Phase0Convergence.lean`:
`phase0MilestonePhase n hn : MilestonePhase (NonuniformMajority L K)`, 0-sorry, with the
`progress` field discharged against the ACTUAL protocol transitions via
`interactionPMF_toMeasure_mcr_phase0_ge → stepDistOrSelf_toMeasure_ge` (the
`countP_eq_sum_count`/class-aggregation mass route). Milestones = `mcrCount`-threshold
decrements of Stage 1 (`RoleMCR,RoleMCR → Main,RoleCR`, paper Lemma 5.1).
`p i = M(M−1)/(n(n−1))`, M from n down to 2.

**TASKS 1 (per-step rates) and 2 (milestone family) are therefore ALREADY DONE** by the
predecessor — over the real kernel, axiom-clean. C-1d added the bridges into the
RoleSplitConcentration interface:
- `roleMCRCount_eq_mcrCount` (countP = filter.card).
- `mcrCount_le_one_of_phase0Post` : `phase0MilestonePhase.Post c` (+ carried card=n,
  all-MCR-phase-0 invariants) ⟹ `mcrCount c ≤ 1` (the last threshold).
- `phase0_milestone_jansonTail` : `phase0MilestonePhase` pushed straight through
  `milestone_hitting_time_bound` (real-kernel Stage-1 Janson tail).

**TASK 3 (balance) — the transitions ARE deterministic 1:1**: Rule 1 (two MCR → one Main
+ one CR) and Rule 4 (two CR → one Clock + one Reserve) are deterministic 1:1 in
`Phase0Transition` (Transition.lean L356–404). So the count-balance is EXACT counting, NOT
Azuma/MGF — once Stage 2 is wired, `|Clock| = |Reserve| = #Rule4-firings` deterministically
(parity ≤ initial), `|Main| = #Rule1-firings`. No in-house drift engine needed for balance.

**BLOCKER (precise) — the witness `potential` field is UNSATISFIABLE for the single-chain
Stage-1 phase.** `roleSplitTail_le_inv_sq` consumes `hpot : log n ≤ pMin · meanTime`. For
`phase0MilestonePhase`:
  * `pMin ≤ 2/(n(n−1)) = Θ(1/n²)` — FORMALIZED as `phase0MilestonePhase_pMin_le_two_div`
    (C-1e, the easy `iInf_le` at the near-empty `M=2` milestone), 0-sorry axiom-clean.
  * `meanTime = Σ 1/p_i = (n−1)²` (telescoping; not yet formalized — gap below).
  * ⟹ `pMin · meanTime = 2(n−1)/n → 2 < log n` for all n ≥ 8. POTENTIAL FAILS.

This is the prompt's own thesis confirmed formally: the naive per-decrement single-chain
Janson with the worst-case `pMin` gives a `Θ(1)` potential, not `Θ(log n)`. The paper's
`Θ(log n)` comes from the COUPON/parallel-time analysis (sum of heterogeneous geometric
waiting times whose COLLECTIVE potential is `Θ(log n)`), already half-built abstractly in
`Phase10ExpectedTime.lean` (`coupon_expectedHitting_le*`). The RoleSplitMilestone witness
must be assembled NOT from a uniform-pMin Janson bound but from the coupon decomposition.

**REMAINING GAPS into the witness (ordered):**
1. Stage-2 milestone family over the real kernel: `RoleCR,RoleCR → Clock,Reserve` (Rule 4)
   at rate `Θ(l²/n²)` — the analogue of `phase0_mcrCount_decrease_prob` for `crCount`
   (reuse `stepDistOrSelf_toMeasure_ge` + an `interactionPMF_toMeasure_cr_*_ge` clone).
2. Either (a) replace the uniform-pMin Janson tail with the coupon decomposition so the
   `Θ(log n)` potential is reachable, OR (b) supply a milestone phase whose `pMin·meanTime`
   genuinely ≥ log n (requires non-uniform p — the coupon route).
3. `post_sound : Post ⊆ RoleSplitGood` — Stage-1 Post gives `mcrCount ≤ 1` (need = 0: parity
   cleanup via the phase-end `RoleCR → Reserve` rule); Stage-2 Post gives the Clock/Reserve
   Θ(n) floors and the Main n/2±εn window via the deterministic 1:1 counts (pure omega).

## Phase C-1 (relay 2) — RESOLUTION of the critical math question

**The pinned obstruction was a MODELING gap in the predecessor's milestone phase, NOT a
property of the protocol. Answer (a) is correct: the protocol HAS one-sided MCR conversion.**

### The paper quote (Lemma 5.1, the Phase-0 top-level split reactions, paper line 2311)

> "Lemma 5.1. Consider the reactions
>   U, U → S_f, M_f
>   S_f, U → S_t, M_f
>   M_f, U → M_t, S_f
> starting with n U agents. … This converges to u = 0 in expected time at most 2.5 ln n and
> in 12.5 ln n time with high probability 1 − O(1/n²)."

with the proof's rate computation:

> "The probability of decreasing u is at least 2(u/n)(1/5), so the number of interactions it
> takes to decrement u is stochastically dominated by a geometric random variable with
> probability p = 2u/(5n). Then the number of interactions for u to decrease from 2n/3 down
> to 0 is dominated by a sum T of geometric random variables with mean
> E[T] = Σ_{u=1}^{2n/3} 5n/(2u) ∼ (5/2) n ln n."

And Lemma 5.2 (paper line 2391) states exactly the role-split postcondition we target:

> "Lemma 5.2. For any ε > 0, with high probability 1 − O(1/n²), by the end of Phase 0,
> |RoleMCR| = 0, (n/2)(1−ε) ≤ |M| ≤ (n/2)(1+ε) and |C|,|R| ≥ (n/4)(1−ε)."

### What this means for the Lean obstruction

The decrement rate is **`p = 2u/(5n) = Θ(u/n)`, NOT `Θ(u²/n²)`**. The `Θ(u/n)` comes from
the SECOND and THIRD reactions of Lemma 5.1 — `S_f,U → S_t,M_f` and `M_f,U → M_t,S_f` — i.e.
an MCR meeting an *already-assigned* RoleCR or Main agent and being one-sidedly converted.
These are precisely **Rules 2 and 3 of `Phase0Transition`** (Protocol/Transition.lean
L364–386, paper pseudocode Lines 4–9), which the Lean protocol ALREADY formalizes:
  * Rule 2 (L364–374, paper Lines 4–6): MCR meets unassigned Main → MCR becomes RoleCR.
  * Rule 3 (L375–386, paper Lines 7–9): MCR meets unassigned RoleCR (non-Main) → MCR becomes Main.
Each decreases `mcrCount` by 1, and the number of such (MCR, assignable-target) ordered pairs
is `u · (#unassigned assignable targets)`. By Lemma 5.1's Chernoff step, `s_f + m_f > n/5`
holds for all future interactions once `u < 2n/3` (the count `s_f + m_f` is non-decreasing),
so the assignable-target count is `Θ(n)` and the per-step decrease probability is `Θ(u/n)`.

**The predecessor's `phase0_mcrCount_decrease_prob` (Phase0Convergence.lean L1672) bounds the
decrease probability using ONLY the MCR–MCR good set** (Rule 1, `Σ count·(M−1) = M(M−1)`),
hence `p ≥ M(M−1)/(n(n−1)) = Θ(M²/n²)` and `pMin = Θ(1/n²)`. That bound is CORRECT but WEAK:
it omits the Rule-2/Rule-3 one-sided good pairs. The honest fix is a STRONGER decrease bound
adding the (MCR × assignable-target) good set, giving `p ≥ Θ(M·n/5 / n²) = Θ(M/n)`, hence a
milestone phase with `pMin = Θ(1/n)`, `meanTime = Σ 5n/(2M) = Θ(n ln n)`, and
`pMin · meanTime = Θ(ln n)` — the potential is SATISFIED.

**FAITHFUL FORM (final):** `RoleSplitGood` and `roleSplitTail` are kept exactly as the
predecessor stated them (paper-faithful to Lemma 5.2: `|RoleMCR| = 0`, the M window, the
C,R floors). The witness's `RoleSplitMilestone.mp.p` must be the `Θ(M/n)` family, not the
predecessor's `Θ(M²/n²)` `phase0MilestonePhase`. The in-file `RoleSplitGood` already encodes
`roleMCRCount = 0` as the target, so NO definition change is needed — only the milestone
family's rate. All C-1c/d/e lemmas are untouched (prompt's "keep predecessors' lemmas intact").

### Honest scope assessment for this relay

Proving the `Θ(M/n)` decrease bound over the real kernel requires the **`s_f + m_f > n/5`
concentration invariant** (Lemma 5.1's Chernoff step) as a hypothesis on the configs the
milestone phase visits — that count is NOT determined by `mcrCount` alone, so a milestone
phase keyed only on `mcrCount` cannot carry it. The faithful witness therefore needs the
invariant threaded as a carried predicate (an `assignableCount c ≥ n/5` side condition,
discharged by a separate epidemic-style monotonicity lemma — the analogue of `informedU`
already used in Phase 2/4). This relay delivers the **count-level building blocks** (the
one-sided assignable-target good set, the `assignableCount` definition, and the real-kernel
config-level `mcrCount` decrement for the one-sided good set) and wires what is mechanically
reachable; the `Θ(M·assignable/n²)` interactionPMF mass bound and the carried-invariant
milestone are the precise documented next gaps (exact signatures below).

### Phase C-1 (relay 2) — DELIVERED LEMMAS (all 0-sorry, axioms ⊆ [propext,Classical.choice,Quot.sound])

In `RoleSplitConcentration.lean` (after `phase0MilestonePhase_pMin_le_two_div`):
- `IsAssignable a` / `assignableCount c` — the one-sided conversion target predicate/count.
- `Phase0Transition_first_no_mcr_of_mcr_main` / `_of_mcr_cr` — Rule-2/Rule-3 s-side effect:
  MCR meets unassigned Main / RoleCR ⟹ s-output non-MCR. (C-1a, C-1b)
- `Phase0Transition_second_no_mcr_of_main_mcr` / `_of_cr_mcr` — t-side mirrors. (C-1b)
- `mcrCount_singleton'` / `mcrCount_pair'` — local pair-count helpers (upstream is private).
- `Phase0Transition_mcrCount_pair_lt_of_one_sided` + concrete `_of_mcr_assignable` /
  `_of_assignable_mcr` — pair-level `1→0` `mcrCount` drop per one-sided conversion. (C-1c)
- `phaseEpidemicUpdate_eq_self_of_both_phase0` + `Transition_roles_eq_phase0_of_both_phase0`
  — both `Transition` wrappers are role-identities at phase 0. (C-1d)
- `mcrCount_config_decrease_of_mcr_assignable` / `_of_assignable_mcr` — **real-kernel
  config-level** `mcrCount` strict decrement for the one-sided good set, the analogue of
  `mcrCount_config_decrease_of_phase0_mcr_pair` (Phase0Convergence) for the `Θ(M/n)` route. (C-1d/e)
- `assignableCount_pred_iff` — Bool↔Prop bridge for the mass/Finset-filter route. (C-1f)

### Phase C-1 (relay 2) — PRECISE REMAINING GAP (exact next-lemma signatures)

The count-level chain is closed up to the **real-kernel config decrement**.  The mass bound
and milestone assembly remain.  Exact next atoms:

1. **Cross-class interaction-count sum** (the easy `s₁≠s₂` analogue of the private
   `sum_interactionCount_mcr`):
   `∑_{s₁ : role=mcr} ∑_{s₂ : assignable} c.interactionCount s₁ s₂ = mcrCount c · assignableCount c`.
   Here `mcr ≠ main,cr ⟹ s₁≠s₂`, so each term is `count s₁ · count s₂` (NO `−1`), giving the
   clean product.  Re-derive `mcrCount_singleton'`-style `sum_count = mcrCount`/`assignableCount`.

2. **One-sided interactionPMF mass bound** (clone `interactionPMF_toMeasure_mcr_phase0_ge`):
   `(c.interactionPMF hc).toMeasure {p | (p.1 mcr∧phase0∧p.2 assignable) ∨ (p.1 assignable∧p.2 mcr∧phase0) ∧ Applicable}
     ≥ ofReal((2·M·assignable)/(n(n−1)))`  (factor 2 = both ordered directions).

3. **Strengthened decrease prob** (clone `phase0_mcrCount_decrease_prob`, chaining #1+#2 through
   `stepDistOrSelf_toMeasure_ge` + the config-decrement lemmas above):
   `stepDistOrSelf c |>.toMeasure {c' | mcrCount c' < mcrCount c} ≥ ofReal((2·M·assignable)/(n(n−1)))`.

4. **The carried `assignableCount ≥ n/5` invariant.** `assignableCount` is NOT a function of
   `mcrCount`, so a milestone phase keyed on `mcrCount` alone cannot carry it.  Need an
   epidemic-style monotonicity lemma (analogue of Phase-2/4 `informedU`): once `mcrCount < 2n/3`,
   `assignableCount` is non-decreasing AND `≥ n/5` (Lemma 5.1's `s_f+m_f > n/5` Chernoff step —
   this is the ONE genuinely probabilistic ingredient, a Chernoff/Azuma bound on the early-phase
   split, not derivable by pure counting).  Thread it as a side predicate in a new milestone
   phase `phase0MilestonePhaseOneSided` whose `p i = (2·M·(n/5))/(n(n−1)) = Θ(M/n)`, giving
   `pMin = Θ(1/n)`, `meanTime = Σ_{M=2}^{n} (n(n−1))/(2·M·(n/5)) = Θ(n log n)`,
   `pMin·meanTime = Θ(log n) ≥ log n` — **the potential the witness needs**.

5. **Assemble `RoleSplitMilestone`** from `phase0MilestonePhaseOneSided` + the Stage-2 crCount
   family (campaign gap 1) + `post_sound` (deterministic 1:1 counts) ⟹ `roleSplitTail_le_inv_sq`
   ⟹ `phase0_roleSplit_whp_inv_sq`.

## Phase C-4: Phase4Convergence (tie detection / non-tie continuation) — COMPLETE

File: `Probability/Phase4Convergence.lean` (NEW, 0-sorry, axioms ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound], no native_decide). Single-file `lake env lean` EXIT_0.

The actual Phase-4 rule (`Protocol/Transition.lean:1042`): a phase-4 agent with a
**big bias** (`bias = .dyadic _ i` with `i.val < L`, i.e. `|bias| > 2^{-L}`) is a witness;
meeting any partner advances BOTH to phase 5 (`advancePhase`). With no big bias the
transition is the identity.

### Honest predicate choices (vs HANDOFF sketch placeholders)
The sketch named `TieAllMinExp`/`Phase3StructuredNonTiePost`/`StableTieOutput`/`Phase5Pre`,
none of which exist. Replaced with honest in-file predicates read off the real rule:
- `noBigBias a` — bias `.zero` or `.dyadic _ i` with `¬ i.val < L` (mirrors the `private`
  `StableEndpoints.phase4NoBigBias`).
- `StableTie4 c` — `∀ a ∈ c, phase=4 ∧ output=T ∧ noBigBias a` (mirrors the `private`
  `StableEndpoints.phase4TieWith`) — the tie `Post`.
- `advancedP a := 5 ≤ a.phase.val`, `advancedU c := countP advancedP`, `advFinished n c := n ≤ advancedU c` — non-tie `Post`.
- `Q4 n c := card=n ∧ ∀ a, 4 ≤ a.phase.val` — non-tie window; `Qwin4 := Q4 ∧ 1 ≤ advancedU` (window + epidemic seed).

### Mechanism
- **Tie branch**: genuinely deterministic. With no big bias the guard never fires;
  `Transition_preserves_tie_pair` ⟹ `StableTie4_stepOrSelf`/`_absorbing` ⟹
  `StableTie4_pow_tail` (`(K^t) c {¬StableTie4} = 0` by induction). ε = 0.
- **Non-tie branch**: the phase-`max` epidemic baked into `phaseEpidemicUpdate`. "informed"
  = `phase ≥ 5`; a mixed (advanced, phase-4) pair sends BOTH outputs to `phase ≥ 5`
  (`Transition_*_phase_ge_pair_max`, public, from `Invariants.lean`). This is the SAME engine
  as `Phase2Convergence`'s opinion epidemic, ported with `advancedU` as the monotone count:
  `advancedP_pair_mono/_advances`, `advancedU_ge_monotone`, the DERIVED rectangle prob
  `advanced_advance_prob` (`≥ m(n−m)/(n(n−1))`), the exponential deficit drift
  `phase4AdvancedDrift`, and the keystone `windowDrift_PhaseConvergence` →
  `phase4NonTieConvergence : PhaseConvergence`.

### Deliverables (theorems)
- `phase4NonTieConvergence (n) (hn:2≤n) (s) (hs:0<s) (t) (ε) (hε) : PhaseConvergence (NonuniformMajority L K).transitionKernel` — Pre = `Qwin4 n`, Post = `Qwin4 n ∧ advFinished n`.
- `phase4Convergence (n) (hn:2≤n) (s) (hs:0<s) (t) (ε) (hε) : PhaseConvergenceW (NonuniformMajority L K).transitionKernel` — the **unified instance**: Pre = `StableTie4 ∨ Qwin4 n`, Post = `StableTie4 ∨ advFinished n`. Tie branch contributes failure 0; ε is the non-tie geometric tail `r^t·exp(s(n−1))` with `r = 1 − ((n−1)/(n(n−1)))(1−e^{−s})`.

### Honest carried assumption (the one documented gap, by design)
The non-tie Pre carries the epidemic **source seed** `1 ≤ advancedU c` (`∃ a, phase ≥ 5`),
exactly as `Phase3Convergence`'s Pre carries `∃ a, 4 ≤ a.phase`. The **witness-bootstrap**
(one witness pair firing to CREATE the first phase-5 agent in O(n) steps, before the spread)
is NOT in this file — it is the upstream/composition's job to supply the source, matching the
repo's established Phase-3 design. This is a deliberate scope boundary, not a sorry: the
witness-firing lemma (per-step `≥ #witness·(n−1)/(n(n−1))` from the `hasBigBias‖` guard) is
the precise next atom if a self-seeding non-tie instance is wanted.

### Phase C-1 (relay 3) — COUNT-IDENTITY FINDING (settles the prompt's hypothesis)

The prompt conjectured `mcrCount + assignableCount = n` on phase-0 configs, which would
make the Chernoff floor invariant unnecessary (pure-counting floor).  **This is FALSE.**
`Role` has FIVE constructors (main, reserve, clock, mcr, cr — Basic/Role.lean).
`assignableCount` counts only **unassigned** main/cr at phase 0.  Three populations are
neither MCR nor assignable: (i) reserve/clock agents (created by Stage-2 Rule 4: cr,cr →
clock,reserve); (ii) **assigned** main/cr agents — and `Phase0Transition` Rules 2,3
explicitly set `assigned := true` on the partner (Transition.lean L364–386), so the
one-sided conversion itself *removes* agents from the assignable pool; (iii) high-phase
agents.  So neither the identity nor a clean monotone `mcrCount + assignableCount = n`
holds, and the `assignableCount ≥ n/5` floor is a GENUINE probabilistic (Chernoff /
Lemma 5.1) ingredient, not derivable by counting.  Confirmed: Rule 1 (mcr,mcr→main,cr)
creates 2 *unassigned* assignables; Rules 2,3 consume one assignable (set assigned) per
MCR converted.

### Phase C-1 (relay 3) — PRECISE REMAINING GAP (atoms #4,#5) — STRUCTURAL BLOCKER

The combined per-step rate `[M(M−1)+M·assignable]/(n(n−1))` is delivered.  Reaching
`pMin = Θ(1/n)` from it needs `assignableCount ≥ n/5` AT THE ADVERSARIAL config.  But
`MilestonePhase.progress` (JansonHitting.lean L48–51) demands the rate `≥ p i`
**unconditionally** at *every* config with milestones `<i` reached and `i` unreached —
there is no slot to carry a side invariant.  For the last milestone (threshold 2), the
config `mcrCount = 2, assignableCount = 0` (all other agents reserve/clock) satisfies the
`progress` antecedent yet has combined rate `2/(n(n−1)) = Θ(1/n²)`, so `progress` with
`p i = Θ(1/n)` is FALSE there.  **The plain `MilestonePhase` cannot carry the floor — this
is the same modeling limitation the predecessor hit, now pinned precisely.**

To close atoms #4,#5, ONE of:
  (A) an **invariant-relative milestone** variant `MilestonePhaseOn` (carry a support-closed
      `Inv` — e.g. `assignableCount ≥ n/5 ∧ AllPhase0`; weaken `progress` to Inv-states;
      thread `Inv` through `milestone_hitting_time_bound`'s MGF chain — mirrors the E2
      `PotNonincrOn`/`coupon_expectedHitting_le_on` `_on`-ladder pattern), PLUS
  (B) the genuinely-probabilistic Chernoff lemma `assignableCount ≥ n/5` whp on the early
      phase-0 split (Lemma 5.1's `s_f + m_f > n/5` step) — NOT in the codebase; needs a
      Chernoff/Azuma bound on the assigned-pool growth.  This is the ONE irreducible
      probabilistic ingredient flagged since relay 1.
Then instantiate `RoleSplitMilestone` (atom #5): Stage-1 milestone via (A)+(B) at combined
rate, Stage-2 crCount family (cr,cr→clock,reserve at Θ(l²/n²), Corollary 4.4), `post_sound`
(deterministic 1:1 counts), → `roleSplitTail_le_inv_sq` → `phase0_roleSplit_whp_inv_sq`.
All the per-step *mass/rate* obligations are now discharged; the gap is (A) milestone-engine
extension + (B) the Chernoff floor.

## Phase C-7 / C-8 — one-sided cancellation (Phases 7 & 8) on the OneSidedCancel engine

Two new files instantiate the generic `OneSidedCancel` engine (form b, crude
uniform drain) for the minority-elimination phases.  Both deliver a real
`PhaseConvergenceW (NonuniformMajority L K).transitionKernel` with the engine's
`hmono` discharged from the actual transition rules; the per-step drain `hstep`
(and, for Phase 7 only, the full `InvClosed`) are carried as honest hypotheses
resting on the documented atoms below.

### Honest predicate / potential choices (vs HANDOFF sketch placeholders)
The sketch named `Phase6PostCore`/`Phase7PostCore`/`NoMinorityAtOrAboveL2`/
`IsMinority`/`NoMinority`/`initialMainCount` — none exist in the repo.  Replaced
with honest in-file predicates read off the real `cancelSplit` / `absorbConsume`
rules:
- `minoritySt σ a := a.role = .main ∧ ∃ i, a.bias = .dyadic σ i` — the Doty `B`-pool
  (minority sign σ a parameter); `minorityU σ c := countP (minoritySt σ) c`.
- `Inv7Main σ n c := card=n ∧ (∀a∈c, phase=7 ∧ role=main) ∧ MinorityHiIdx σ c` —
  Phase-7 window with the **index ordering** `MinorityHiIdx σ` (every σ-Main at
  exponent index ≥ every majority Main's index = Doty's "majority has larger mass").
- `Phase8AllMain n c := card=n ∧ ∀a∈c, phase=8 ∧ role=main` — Phase-8 window (no
  ordering needed: `absorbConsume` is sign-preserving).
- `NoMinority σ c := minorityU σ c = 0` = engine `potDone (minorityU σ)` — the
  honest `Post` (cancellation/consumption drains the WHOLE minority pool to 0).

### The honest mathematical core (the hard part, fully proved & axiom-clean)
**Phase 7 — `cancelSplit` minority non-increase.**  The gap-2 branch
`+2^{-i}, −2^{-j}  →  ±2^{-(i+1)}, ±2^{-(i+2)}` (j=i+2) copies the smaller-index
agent's sign onto BOTH outputs.  So the σ-count can only rise if the minority is the
smaller-index (higher-magnitude) agent — which the carried `MinorityHiIdx` ordering
forbids.  `cancelSplit_minorityU_pair_le` proves per-pair non-increase under that
ordering by exhausting all five `cancelSplit` branches against the index hypothesis
(C-7b).  **Phase 8 — `absorbConsume` minority non-increase** is UNCONDITIONAL: every
branch zeroes one bias or is identity, never flips a sign, so no ordering is needed
(`absorbConsume_minorityU_pair_le`, C-8b).

These per-pair facts lift through `Transition` (the reductions
`Transition_eq_{cancelSplit,absorbConsume}_of_phase{7,8}_main`: phase-7/8 epidemic =
id, phase-preserving rule, finishPhase10Entry = id; not-both-main leaves Mains
untouched) → config step (`minorityU_stepOrSelf_le`) → kernel support
(`minorityU_le_on_support`) → the engine's `PotNonincrOn`
(`potNonincrOn_minorityU`, typechecks against `OneSidedCancel.PotNonincrOn`).

### InvClosed
- **Phase 8: FULL** `invClosed_phase8AllMain` (typechecks against
  `OneSidedCancel.InvClosed`) — `absorbConsume` preserves phase + role, every pair on
  the window is both-Main, card via `reachable_card_eq`.  No documented gap.
- **Phase 7: structural core proved** (`Phase7AllMain_support_closed`: card+phase+role
  via `cancelSplit_phase`/`cancelSplit_role`).  The remaining atom is
  **`MinorityHiIdx σ` closure under `cancelSplit`** (gap-1 lowers the survivor's index
  by 1, gap-2 produces two fresh indices i+1,i+2) — exposed as the `hClosed` hypothesis
  of `phase7Convergence`.

### Remaining atoms (documented boundary, by design — both files 0-sorry)
1. **The drain `hstep`** (both files): per-step failure-to-consume ≤ q from the
   eliminator floor — the Phase-4 `advanced_advance_prob_of_rect` analogue
   (eliminator-state × minority-state interaction-count rectangle → probability).
   The eliminator floor is the carried Doty Lemma 7.4/7.6 fact (≥0.8|M| majority vs
   ≤0.2|M| minority).  **Phase 8 shrinking-eliminator handling**: `absorbConsume` sets
   the consumer `full := true` (it drops from the eliminator pool), but Φ=minorityU is
   non-increasing regardless of `full` (consumption only zeroes biases — proved
   unconditionally), and the floor enters ONLY through `q`; the honest invariant is
   non-full-majority ≥ minority-remaining + margin (Lemma 7.6).
2. **Phase 7 `MinorityHiIdx` closure** (Phase 7 only) — see above.

### Deliverables (theorems)

### Three-window chaining (Phase 7 levels −l, −(l+1), −(l+2))
The paper's three successive elimination windows compose via
`composeW_two_phases` (twice) on the three `phase7Convergence` instances at the
three index levels (the Pre/Post `minorityU σ ≤ M₀ → = 0` chain links directly).
Documented; not assembled here pending the per-level drain `q m` from the rectangle.

### Phase C-7i…C-8j (relay 4) — the DRAIN RECTANGLE LAYER (the `hstep`/`hdrop` floor)

Built the full drain chain for both phases, end-to-end down to the carried eliminator
floor.  Both files compile single-file EXIT_0, every new theorem axiom-clean (⊆
[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]).

**Phase 8 (`absorbConsume`, unconditional):**
- **C-8f** SHA 20e4369b `absorbConsume_minorityU_pair_drop`: per-pair strict drain —
  `s`=σ-minority@i, `t`=opposite-sign Main@j with `j>i`, `¬t.full` ⇒ second consume
  branch zeroes `s` ⇒ pair σ-count drops by 1 (`+1 ≤`).
- **C-8g** SHA 72662b7e `minorityU_stepOrSelf_drop`: lift to config — an applicable
  (minority@i, elim@>i,¬full) pair drops global `minorityU σ` by 1.
- **C-8h** SHA 44431bda `drop_prob_of_rect`: the Φ-AGNOSTIC drop-rectangle bound — the
  DUAL of `Phase4Convergence.advanced_advance_prob_of_rect`, targeting the DECREASE
  event `{c' | Φ c'+1 ≤ Φ c}`.  Rect `R` of per-cell-drop pairs ⇒ drop-prob ≥
  N/(n(n−1)), N ≤ ∑_R interactionCount.  (Later relocated to Phase 7, see C-7j.)
- **C-8i** SHA e9f07b11 `minorityU_drop_prob_rect`: per-level rect `minorityAt(i) ×ˢ
  elimAbove(i)` (cross pairs distinct via index i vs >i) ⇒ drop-prob ≥
  #min(i)·#elim(>i)/(n(n−1)).
- **C-8j** SHA 6b265ccc `minorityU_hdrop_of_floor`: the engine `hdrop` from a
  drop-probability floor `p`.  Drop-success event `{Φ c'+1 ≤ m} = potBelow Φ m`;
  `transitionKernel` is Markov (total mass 1) ⇒ failure `K b (potBelow Φ m)ᶜ = 1 −
  success ≤ 1 − p`.  This is the level-decomposed-engine (form a) `hdrop` shape.

**Phase 7 (`cancelSplit` gap-1, drop direction needs only gap-1 geometry):**
- **C-7i** SHA 9ff3831f `cancelSplit_minorityU_pair_drop` + `minorityU_stepOrSelf_drop`:
  gap-1 cell — `s`=σ.flip-elim@i, `t`=σ-minority@j=i+1 ⇒ gap-1 branch zeroes the
  larger-index agent `t` (minority) ⇒ drops by 1; lifted to config.
- **C-7j** SHA 582a5011: shared generic `drop_prob_of_rect` +
  `sum_interactionCount_cross_disjoint7` now live in Phase 7 (imported by Phase 8);
  `minorityU_drop_prob_rect7` (rect `elimGap1(i) ×ˢ minorityAt7(j)`, i+1=j) +
  `minorityU_hdrop_of_floor7` (the Phase-7 hdrop bridge).

**What remains (the genuine documented boundary — the carried floor `p`):**
The engine `hdrop`/`hstep` is now `1 − p`-shaped where `p = #min·#elim/(n(n−1))` is the
rectangle floor.  Supplying a CONCRETE non-trivial `p` (the level-m drain rate) requires
the carried eliminator floor `#elim ≥ margin` and `#min ≥ 1` — Doty Lemma 7.4/7.6's
`≥0.8|M|` majority vs `≤0.2|M|` minority — which is a CARRIED INVARIANT, not derivable
from the transition rule.  The mathematical layer from rule → per-cell drop → rectangle
→ drop-probability → engine `hdrop` is now FULLY PROVED; only the floor's numeric value
is the carried Doty input.

### Phase C-7 (relay 4) — FINDING: `MinorityHiIdx` is NOT closed under `cancelSplit`

The Phase-7 `hClosed` atom (the `MinorityHiIdx σ` closure carried as a hypothesis of
`phase7Convergence`) is **NOT provable as stated** — `MinorityHiIdx` is genuinely not
one-step closed.  Counterexample mechanism: `MinorityHiIdx` permits a σ-Main and a
σ.flip-Main coexisting at the SAME index (they form a gap-0 pair satisfying `i ≤ i`).
A gap-1 fire on a DIFFERENT σ.flip-Main@i with a σ-Main@i+1 RAISES that majority agent's
index to i+1, which then exceeds the coexisting σ-Main still at index i ⇒ ordering
violated.  Strict separation and fixed-threshold variants fail identically (cancelSplit
RAISES the surviving majority's index toward the minority levels — the survivor lands on
the consumed minority's vacated level, where another minority may sit).  This matches the
campaign's own §6 note (line 199): the cancel stage uses a CONSERVED SIGNED SUM, not an
index ordering, for |B| monotonicity.  **Conclusion:** Phase-7 `minorityU` non-increase
genuinely needs the ordering per-pair (gap-2 sign-copy), but the ordering invariant is
fragile; the correct closed Phase-7 invariant is the signed-sum potential, a different
construction.  The drain rectangle (C-7i/j) is INDEPENDENT of `hClosed` — it needs only
the gap-1 cell geometry, so it stands regardless.

### Phase C-7k…C-7m (relay 5) — REBUILT the Phase-7 invariant layer on the CONSERVED SIGNED SUM

The relay-5 work replaces the broken `MinorityHiIdx`-carrying `Inv7Main` with the
genuinely-closed signed-sum invariant.  All in `Phase7Convergence.lean`, single-file
EXIT_0, every new theorem `#print axioms ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
Phase8Convergence.lean (importer) still EXIT_0, untouched.

- **C-7k** SHA `45419405` — signed-mass infra + `cancelSplit_agentSignedMass_pair_eq`.
  `biasSignedMass L : Bias L → ℤ` = the `2^L`-scaled signed dyadic mass (`±2^{L-i}` for
  `dyadic ± i`, integer since `i ≤ L`); `agentSignedMass`, `phase7SignedSum c = ∑`.
  Per-pair conservation across ALL FIVE `cancelSplit` branches (gap-0 `+x−x=0`; gap-1
  `2^{L-i}−2^{L-(i+1)}=2^{L-(i+1)}`; gap-2 `2^{L-i}−2^{L-(i+2)}=2^{L-(i+1)}+2^{L-(i+2)}`),
  proved by `cases ss <;> cases st <;> simp_all [biasSignedMass] <;> simp only [pow_succ] <;> ring`.
- **C-7l** SHA `5ebe7148` — config+support conservation + `invClosed_Inv7Sum` (the
  discharged `hClosed`).  `phase7SignedSum_stepOrSelf_eq` lifts the per-pair identity
  through the `c−{r₁,r₂}+{out₁,out₂}` step decomposition (mirror of
  `phase10ActiveSignedSum_stepRel_eq`'s `add_left_comm` arithmetic), self-case identity;
  `phase7SignedSum_support_eq` lifts to the kernel support; `Inv7Sum n c := Phase7AllMain
  n c ∧ 0 < phase7SignedSum c`; `invClosed_Inv7Sum` discharges the
  `OneSidedCancel.InvClosed` shape (off-support mass 0 via the Phase-8 disjoint-support
  pattern, on-support both conjuncts stable).
- **C-7m** SHA `d49510fc` — the residual gap as a HARD per-pair fact +
  the rebuilt instance.  `gap2_minorityU_rise_compatible_with_pos_sum`: a gap-2 cancel
  on (σ-minority @ smaller index `i`, σ.flip @ `i+2`) makes BOTH outputs σ-minority
  (pair `minorityU` RISES +1) WHILE conserving the signed mass — so `0 < phase7SignedSum`
  CANNOT supply per-pair `minorityU` non-increase.  `phase7Convergence'`: the rebuilt
  `PhaseConvergenceW` on `Inv7Sum` with `hClosed = invClosed_Inv7Sum n` now INTERNAL
  (proved, not carried); `Pre = Inv7Sum ∧ minorityU ≤ M₀`, `Post = Inv7Sum ∧ minorityU = 0`.

**Net status of the Phase-7 `phase7Convergence'` instance** (relay 5):
- `hClosed` — **DISCHARGED** (`invClosed_Inv7Sum n`, fully internal).
- `hmono : PotNonincrOn Inv7Sum K minorityU` — **carried** (honest residual).  This is
  strictly stronger than `0 < signedSum`: `gap2_minorityU_rise_compatible_with_pos_sum`
  proves the gap-2 minority rise is signed-sum-conserving, so per-pair `minorityU`
  monotonicity genuinely needs the per-pair ordering content (the minority at the
  SMALLER magnitude / LARGER index) ON TOP of the signed-sum invariant.  The
  signed-sum is the right *closed* potential for `hClosed`; it is not by itself the
  monotonicity certificate.  The old `Inv7Main` carried `MinorityHiIdx` to get `hmono`
  but then could not close it — relay 5 trades that for a closed invariant + an honest
  carried `hmono`.
- `hstep` — carried (the eliminator floor, unchanged from relay 4; rectangle layer is
  independent of the invariant choice).

**Precise remaining gap (for the next relay).**  To discharge `hmono` honestly one
needs a configurational invariant that (i) is one-step closed and (ii) implies, on every
both-Main pair, that the σ-minority sits at the larger index (so the gap-2 sign-copy
never lands on a majority agent).  Candidate: carry `Inv7Sum` PLUS a SEPARATE
"minority-mass-bounded" fact `phase7MinoritySignedMass ≤ phase7MajoritySignedMass − margin`
(the per-level Doty Lemma 7.4 floor as a signed-mass inequality, not an index ordering) —
this is conserved/monotone by the same `cancelSplit_agentSignedMass_pair_eq` machinery
restricted to each sign class, and DOES force the per-pair ordering.  Not yet built; the
signed-mass split by sign class is the natural next atom.

### Phase C-7n…C-7p (relay 6) — `hmono` DISCHARGED via the SIGN-CLASS MASS potential

Relay 6 closes the residual `hmono` gap, NOT by carrying an extra inequality, but by
**replacing the potential**: the engine is driven by the σ-class MASS `classMassN σ`
(non-increasing) instead of the count `minorityU σ` (which the relay-5 obstruction showed
can RISE).  All in `Phase7Convergence.lean`, single-file EXIT_0, Phase8 importer EXIT_0,
every new theorem `#print axioms ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

**Licensed-check outcome (global vs per-level potential).**  Verified against the paper
(`/tmp/doty_paper.txt`).  Lemma 7.4 is a MASS-floor (`|M'| ≥ 0.8|M|` because the only way
to lose a majority agent is cancelling against minority, bounded by the minority MASS
`β_ ≤ 0.004|M|2^{-l}`); Lemma 7.5 is SUCCESSIVE per-level elimination
(`|B_{-l}|→0`, then `|B_{-(l+1)}|→0`, then `|B_{-(l+2)}|→0`).  **Both a global `minorityU`
and any per-level `minorityAt7 i` potential need `PotNonincrOn` for THAT Φ, and BOTH are
broken by the identical gap-2 sign-copy** (the engine `crude_PhaseConvergenceW`
structurally requires `hmono` — it makes `{Φ ≤ m}` absorbing).  Switching to per-level does
NOT dodge the obstruction.  The genuinely non-increasing object is the **σ-class mass**:
the paper's own Lemma 7.4 mass argument.  So: built the mass potential, NOT a per-level
count.  Documented.

- **C-7n** SHA `739da267` — `biasClassMass σ`/`agentClassMass σ`/`classMass σ`
  (nonnegative `2^L`-scaled σ-class dyadic mass) + `cancelSplit_classMass_pair_le`:
  per-pair σ-class mass NON-INCREASE in EVERY `cancelSplit` branch, NO index-ordering
  hypothesis.  Crucial gap-2 branch (the relay-5 obstruction): the smaller-index class
  GAINS `2^{L-(i+1)}+2^{L-(i+2)} = 2^{L-i}-2^{L-(i+2)}` and LOSES `2^{L-i}`, net DROP
  `2^{L-(i+2)}` — the minority *mass* DROPS exactly where its *count* rises.
- **C-7o** SHA `e88d93e4` — `classMass_stepOrSelf_le`/`classMass_support_le` (config &
  support lift, mirror of `phase7SignedSum_stepOrSelf_eq` with `=`→`≤`), the ℕ-potential
  `classMassN σ := (classMass σ).toNat`, `potNonincrOn_classMassN` (**the engine `hmono`
  on `Inv7Sum`, DISCHARGED**), and the bridge `minorityU_eq_zero_of_classMassN_zero`
  (`classMass σ c = 0` ⟹ `minorityU σ c = 0`, since each σ-Main contributes mass `≥ 1`).
- **C-7p** SHA `1f4b7654` — `phase7Convergence''`: the CLEANED engine on `Inv7Sum` with
  `Φ = classMassN σ`, **BOTH** `hClosed = invClosed_Inv7Sum n` **AND**
  `hmono = potNonincrOn_classMassN σ n` PROVED INTERNAL (no longer carried).
  `phase7Convergence''_post_noMinority`: `Post` (`Inv7Sum ∧ classMassN σ = 0`) ⟹
  `NoMinority σ`.

**Net status (relay 6).**
- `hClosed` — DISCHARGED (`invClosed_Inv7Sum n`).
- `hmono`   — **DISCHARGED** (`potNonincrOn_classMassN σ n`).  The relay-5 residual is
  closed: the obstruction was to the COUNT, not the MASS.
- `hstep`   — carried, **now phrased on `classMassN σ`** (a σ-class-MASS drain, the Doty
  Lemma 7.4/7.5 floor as a mass drain), in `phase7Convergence''`.

**Precise remaining gap (for the next relay).**  The drain rectangle layer (C-7i/j,
`minorityU_drop_prob_rect7`) proves a *count* drop per gap-1 cell; the cleaned engine's
`hstep` needs a *mass* drop.  The re-derivation is mechanical: a gap-1 cancel
(minority@i+1, majority@i) removes the minority agent, dropping `classMassN σ` by
`2^{L-(i+1)}` (its mass) — so the per-pair `classMass`-drop building block
(`cancelSplit_classMass_pair_drop`, gap-1, `+2^{L-(i+1)} ≤`) plus the existing
`drop_prob_of_rect` machinery re-instantiated for `classMassN` yields the carried `hstep`.
The signed/count rectangle geometry is unchanged; only the potential in the cells differs.
Three-window chaining (Lemma 7.5's `B_{-l}→B_{-(l+1)}→B_{-(l+2)}`) then chains three
`phase7Convergence''` instances at the per-level mass budgets.

### Phase C-1 (relay 4) — GAP (A) CLOSED + GAP (B) PINNED DETERMINISTICALLY

**Gap (A) — the invariant-relative milestone engine — COMPLETE (0-sorry, axiom-clean).**
Commits: C-1j (in 85eb8280, bundled by a concurrent agent) + C-1k 60eba6a5 + C-1m 718b0d5a.
New generic engine `MilestonePhaseOn` in RoleSplitConcentration.lean (own namespace):
- structure with side invariant `Inv`, one-step-closure `inv_closed`, and
  `progress_on` required ONLY at `Inv`-configs (the slot the plain `MilestonePhase`
  lacks).  `toDummyMP` (milestone := fun _ _ => True) borrows the pure-MGF
  optimisation `janson_exponential_tail_from_mgf` verbatim (pMin/meanTime depend
  only on (k,p), so `rfl`-equal).
- full Inv-relative MGF chain re-derived (JansonHitting privates not exported):
  `mgfFactor`/`partialMGF`/`truncMGF`, `partialMGF_one_step_contraction_on`
  (the only place `progress_on` is consumed — with `Inv c` exactly available),
  `truncMGF_contracts_on`, `lintegral_geometric_decay_on` (induction using
  `inv_closed` to stay in `Inv`, mass 0 off `Inv`), `milestone_tail_bound_via_mgf_on`
  (Markov), capstone `milestone_hitting_time_bound_on` — SAME
  `exp(-pMin·meanTime·(λ-1-ln λ))` tail as the plain engine.
- assembled discharge: `roleSplitTail_le_milestoneTail_on` → `_jansonExp_on` →
  `roleSplitTail_le_inv_sq_on` (1/n² budget from a floor-carrying witness).
Mirrors the E2 `InvClosed`/`PotNonincrOn` `_on`-ladder, lifted to the Janson engine.

**Gap (B) — the floor — PINNED: deterministic skeleton FAILS in this encoding,
Chernoff is genuinely needed (0-sorry, axiom-clean).** Commit C-1l 1acd65ae.
Tried the prompt's deterministic regime-split FIRST; proved the per-rule
`assignableCount` delta at the transition level, which SETTLES the route:
- `assignable_rule2_s_stays`: Rule 2 (MCR + unassigned Main) makes the MCR a
  FRESH unassigned CR (role=cr, ¬assigned, phase 0) → Rule 2 CONSERVES, Δ = 0.
- `assignable_rule3_s_assigned`: Rule 3 (MCR + unassigned RoleCR) makes the MCR an
  ASSIGNED Main → Rule 3 CONSUMES, Δ = −1.
Net per-rule: R1 +2, R2 0, R3 −1, R4 −2.  So `assignableCount` is NOT monotone in
THIS encoding — unlike the paper's reaction 3 `Mf,U → Mt,Sf` which creates a fresh
unassigned `Sf` and conserves the pool (the paper's "sf+mf can never decrease").
The divergence is Rule 3: our encoding marks the converted MCR as an *assigned*
Main rather than producing a fresh *unassigned* RoleCR.  Therefore the clean
deterministic floor does NOT transfer; Gap (B) needs the genuine Chernoff floor
(`assignableCount ≥ n/5` whp on the early split, paper Lemma 5.1's Chernoff step) —
the ONE irreducible probabilistic ingredient flagged since relay 1.  This is now a
*proven* fact, not a guess.

**REMAINING to finish Lemma 5.2** (exact inputs to `roleSplitTail_le_inv_sq_on`):
  (i) construct the `MilestonePhaseOn` witness: milestone = `mcrCount` thresholds,
      `Inv` = `assignableCount ≥ n/5 ∧ AllPhase0` (or the paper's `sf+mf > n/5`
      monotone surrogate — note R3 means `assignableCount` itself is not the right
      monotone, so `Inv` should be a CHERNOFF-established floor, carried by
      `inv_closed` once established), `progress_on` = combined rate `Θ(M/n)` from
      `phase0_mcrCount_decrease_prob_combined` (already delivered) restricted to
      `Inv`-configs where `assignableCount ≥ n/5` makes the rate `≥ Θ(M/n)`,
      `inv_closed` = the floor is one-step-closed (needs the Chernoff floor to be a
      closed invariant — i.e. once `≥ n/5`, the regime where it can't drop below).
  (ii) Gap (B) Chernoff: `assignableCount ≥ n/5` whp while `u ≥ 2n/3` (paper's
       fraction-½-top-reaction Chernoff).  Via in-house MGF/drift (NOT axiomatised).
  (iii) Stage-2 (cr,cr→clock,reserve at Θ(l²/n²), Corollary 4.4): own milestone
        family, same diagonal pattern; chain stages via composition.
All per-step *mass/rate* obligations and the *engine* (Gap A) are now discharged;
the genuine open work is (ii) the Chernoff floor + (i) wiring it as `inv_closed`.

### Phase C-1 (relay 5) — FLOOR→RATE BRIDGE DELIVERED + INV_CLOSED WALL PROVEN STRUCTURAL

Commits: C-1n 69a8e2af (floor→rate bridge) · C-1o 7421b90b (floorRate p-field validity).

**Task (i) mechanical core — DELIVERED (0-sorry, axiom-clean ⊆ [propext,Classical.choice,Quot.sound]).**
- `phase0_mcrCount_decrease_prob_floor (c n a₀) (card=n) (n≥2) (mcr⇒phase0)
  (a₀ ≤ assignableCount c) : stepDistOrSelf-mass {mcrCount drops} ≥
  ofReal((mcrCount·a₀)/(n(n−1)))`.  Drops the diagonal `M(M−1) ≥ 0` term off
  `phase0_mcrCount_decrease_prob_combined` and keeps the floor-driven `M·a₀` term.
  This is EXACTLY the `progress_on` rate the `MilestonePhaseOn` engine consumes —
  the mechanical wiring that *consumes* a floor once supplied.  The floor enters
  as an abstract `a₀ ≤ assignableCount c` hypothesis (no `n/5` baked in).
- `floorRate n a₀ M := (M·a₀)/(n(n−1))` + `floorRate_pos` (M≥1,a₀≥1,n≥2) +
  `floorRate_le_one` (M≤n, a₀≤n−1).  These are the `MilestonePhaseOn.hp_pos` /
  `hp_le_one` fields for the floor-driven `p i`.  (`a₀ ≈ n/5 ≤ n−1` for n≥2, so
  `floorRate_le_one` covers the Chernoff floor; the high-M milestones where
  M·a₀ might exceed n(n−1) are carried by the diagonal term, not floorRate.)

**THE `inv_closed` WALL IS STRUCTURAL — PROVEN, NOT A GUESS.**  The inherited
`MilestonePhaseOn.inv_closed` demands DETERMINISTIC one-step closure
(`transitionKernel c {c'|¬Inv c'} = 0`).  A whp Chernoff floor CANNOT satisfy this:
1. **No deterministic floor exists.**  `Phase0Initial` ⟹ ALL n agents are MCR ⟹
   `assignableCount = 0` at t=0 (`IsAssignable` needs role∈{main,cr}, but all are mcr).
   The assignable pool is *created* by R1 (+2 per firing), so it grows from 0 — there
   is no deterministic relation `mcrCount large ⟹ assignableCount ≥ a₀` to lean on.
   Combined with relay-4's proven non-monotonicity (R3 `assignable_rule3_s_assigned`
   marks the converted MCR ASSIGNED, Δassignable = −1), `assignableCount ≥ a₀` is
   neither initially-true nor deterministically-closed for any a₀ ≥ 1.
2. **The leak-relaxation does NOT reduce to a union bound.**  Relaxing `inv_closed`
   to a per-step leak ε (mass ≤ ε on ¬Inv) FAILS cleanly because `truncMGF` is NOT
   bounded by 1 off `Inv`: `partialMGF = ∏ mgfFactor` with each factor ≥ 1, so the
   leak set carries the FULL (unbounded) MGF, not ε.  Bounding the leak contribution
   needs the chain to not re-enter ¬Inv with large MGF — a genuine coupling/absorption
   argument (the paper's actual Lemma 5.1 joint-process Chernoff), NOT mechanical wiring.

**PRECISE REMAINING GAP (the irreducible probabilistic core, unchanged in nature
from relay 1, now bounded tightly).**  To finish Lemma 5.2 one needs a NEW engine
that threads the floor probabilistically — either:
  (a) a joint (mcrCount, assignableCount) Chernoff/Azuma showing
      `assignableCount ≥ n/5 whp throughout the Stage-1 horizon`, fed as a separate
      union-bound budget term `εfloor ≤ exp(−Θ(n))` ADDED to the `1/n²` Janson tail
      (NOT through `Inv`); the `MilestonePhaseOn` engine then runs on the EVENT
      `{floor holds throughout}` where `progress_on` is valid by C-1n; or
  (b) a coupling absorbing the ¬Inv excursions.
Both are the paper's Lemma 5.1 probabilistic content; neither is assemblable from
the delivered count/rate atoms.  C-1n + C-1o discharge the ENTIRE rate side: given
the floor as a hypothesis (`a₀ ≤ assignableCount c`), the `Θ(M/n)` progress rate
and its `hp_pos`/`hp_le_one` validity are now mechanical.  The open atom is the
SINGLE Chernoff floor (`assignableCount ≥ n/5 whp`), and its wiring is now (a):
a union term, because the engine's deterministic `inv_closed` provably cannot host it.

**Stage 2 (task 3) — NOT STARTED** (blocked behind Stage-1 floor for the chained
assembly; the crCount milestone family is mechanically analogous to Stage-1's
diagonal R1 part once the Stage-1 floor route is fixed, but the crCount floor
itself flows from the Stage-1 assignable→cr output, so it sits downstream of (a)).

### Phase C-1 (relay 6) — KILLED-KERNEL ROUTE: inv_closed DISSOLVED, floor as additive union (0-sorry, axiom-clean)

**THE RESOLUTION of relay-5's structural inv_closed wall — DELIVERED.**  Relay 5 proved the
deterministic `MilestonePhaseOn.inv_closed` provably cannot host a whp floor.  Relay 6
realises route (a) — the floor as an additive union term — via the immediate-kill gated
kernel `GatedDrift.killK_now` (GatedKillNow.lean, inherited).  `RoleSplitConcentration.lean`
now imports GatedKillNow and adds the full route:

1. **Structural decomposition (C-1p/q/r).**  `real_bad_le_escape_add_killedAliveBad`:
   `(K^t) x {bad} ≤ killed{none} + killed{alive-bad}` (via `real_le_killed_now` +
   subadditivity).  `killedEscape_le_prefix` re-exports `kill_now_escape_le_prefix_union`
   (εfloor ≤ t·q + ∑_{τ<t}(K^τ)x Sᶜ).  `real_bad_le_killedAliveBad_add_escape` assembles
   them.  `killedAliveBad_le_killedAliveNotGood`: alive-bad ⊆ alive-(¬good) when good⊃¬bad.

2. **Kernel-generic milestone engine `KernelMilestone` (C-1s–C-1y) — THE NEW ENGINE.**
   The protocol-bound `MilestonePhaseOn` uses `P.stepDistOrSelf.support`; `killK_now` is a
   bare `Kernel (Option α) (Option α)`.  Re-derived the ENTIRE Janson MGF tail over an
   ABSTRACT Markov kernel `Q : Kernel β β` ([DiscreteMeasurableSpace β] [Countable β]),
   with kernel positive-mass support (`0 < Q c {c'}`) replacing PMF support and — crucially
   — **NO `Inv`/`inv_closed` field**: `progress`/`milestone_monotone` are GLOBAL, so the
   contraction holds at every state (cemetery included).  Pieces:
   - `measure_compl_eq_zero_of_singleton` (the PMF-free support→ae bridge: on a countable
     discrete space, zero singleton-masses ⟹ null set; replaces
     `PMF.toMeasure_apply_eq_zero_iff`).
   - `mgfFactor`/`partialMGF`/`truncMGF` + `partialMGF_mono_of_support`/`_drop_reached`
     (kernel support), `post_absorbing` (via the null-set bridge), `firstUnreached`
     selectors, `partialMGF_pointwise_bound`, `partialMGF_one_step_contraction` (where
     `progress` is consumed; reuses `MilestonePhaseOn.mgf_contraction_identity`),
     `truncMGF_contracts`, `lintegral_geometric_decay` (plain induction — NO inv-closure
     threading), `not_post_subset_ge_one`, `pMin_pos`/`pMin_le`,
     `milestone_tail_bound_via_mgf`, CAPSTONE `milestone_hitting_time_bound` (same Janson
     tail `exp(−pMin·meanTime·(λ−1−ln λ))`, host `Protocol P` borrows the pure-MGF opt via
     `toDummyMP`, all `(k,p)`-determined rfl-equal).

3. **Stage-1 union assembly (C-1z).**  `killedAliveNotGood_le_janson`: a `KernelMilestone
   (killK_now K G)` witness whose `Post (some y) ⟹ good y` bounds killed-alive-(¬good) by
   the Janson tail.  `real_bad_le_janson_add_escape` (HEADLINE):
     `(K^t) c₀ {¬good} ≤ exp(−pMin·meanTime·(λ−1−ln λ)) + (t·q + ∑_{τ<t}(K^τ)c₀ Sᶜ)`.
   The floor enters ONLY as the additive escape budget; `inv_closed` is DISSOLVED into the
   `killK_now` construction (`alive_support_gate` makes alive⟹gated by construction, which
   the witness's `progress` exploits).  Per-theorem `#print axioms ⊆ [propext,
   Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; single-file EXIT_0.

**Warm-up / gate design (chosen).**  Gate `G` := the floor region {assignableCount ≥ floor}
∪ the milestone region.  c₀ (all-MCR, assignableCount = 0) is handled by the side-set `S`
machinery of `kill_now_escape_le_prefix_union`: `S` = the favourable-drift regime, the
prefix `∑ (K^τ)c₀ Sᶜ` term absorbs the warm-up where the floor is not yet established (the
early R1-dominated phase where assignable grows from 0).  The engine clock effectively
starts once gated; the escape prefix is the honest warm-up cost.

**εfloor final form.**  `εfloor = t·q + ∑_{τ<t}(K^τ)c₀ Sᶜ`, where `q` = per-step
gate-exit (floor-breach) probability on the favourable regime `S` (the Chernoff per-step
rate), and the prefix is the mass of having left `S`.  Both are `n^{-2}`-shape, unioned
with the `1/n²` Janson budget of the alive-bad term.

**Stage-1 status: STRUCTURALLY COMPLETE up to one concrete construction.**  Everything
abstract is discharged 0-sorry axiom-clean.  The SINGLE remaining atom is now sharply
isolated: construct the concrete `KernelMilestone (killK_now K G)` witness for the role
split — define the lifted mcrCount-threshold milestones on `Option (Config …)`, prove
`milestone_monotone` (via `alive_support_gate` + the protocol's mcrCount monotonicity) and
`progress` (via the floor→rate bridge `phase0_mcrCount_decrease_prob_floor`, valid because
alive⟹gated⟹floor) — together with the Chernoff numbers for `q` and the prefix `Sᶜ`-mass.
This is genuinely probabilistic (the paper's Lemma 5.1 content) but now plugs into a fully
wired interface; no more engine work.  Stage 2 (crCount) reuses `KernelMilestone` verbatim.
