  Ripple.DualRail.Method — Unified annihilation method interface.

  Two proven methods for constructing the annihilation term in dual-railing:

    M1. **Polynomial-scale**: Z_i = P̂_i⁺ + P̂_i⁻
        [RTCRN2/DNA25, Huang-Klinge-Lathrop 2019]
        Boundedness: `DNA25Bounded.lean` (0 sorry)

    M2. **Constant-rate**: Z = k (single constant for all species)
        [UCNC25 Problem 1, resolved in Huang-Huang 2025]
        Boundedness: `ConstantAnnihilationGeneral.lean` +
                     `ScalarCubic.lean` + `ScalarQuintic.lean` (0 sorry)

  This file provides a unified `AnnihilationMethod` type and dispatches
  to the existing constructions. The method is orthogonal to the strategy
  (which variables to dual-rail); the two dimensions combine in
  `Combination.lean`.

/-- The two proven annihilation methods for dual-railing.

  Given species pair `(u_i, v_i)` with `u_i − v_i = y_i`, the shared
  annihilation term `−Z · u_i · v_i` prevents the pair from drifting apart.
  The two methods differ in the choice of Z:

  - `polynomialScale`: Z_i = P̂_i⁺(u,v) + P̂_i⁻(u,v), coupling the
    annihilation rate to the system's own dynamics. Produces more species
    when composed (the annihilation term itself is a polynomial in all
    dual-railed variables).

  - `constantRate k`: Z = k (a single positive rational), decoupling the
    annihilation from the polynomial structure. Cleaner for incremental
    dual-railing since the annihilation term doesn't introduce new
    cross-dependencies. -/

/-- Apply an annihilation method to construct a full (all-at-once) dual-rail
system. This dispatches to the existing `polynomialScaleDualRail` and
`constantAnnihilationDualRail` constructions.

This is Strategy S1 (all-at-once): every variable is dual-railed.

/-! ## Boundedness results

Both methods produce bounded dual-rail systems from bounded original GPACs.
The proofs are in `DNA25Bounded.lean` and `ConstantAnnihilationGeneral.lean`
respectively, using `OriginalBounded` as the input hypothesis.

Note: `polynomialScaleDualRail_bounded` (in DNA25Bounded.lean) uses the
`BoundedTimeComputable` interface rather than `OriginalBounded`, so it is
not directly restated here. The constant-rate result aligns directly. -/

/-- **Boundedness of M2 (constant-rate).**
If the original GPAC is bounded with bound β, then for some k > 0,
the constant-rate dual-rail system is bounded by 2β and tracks the
original trajectory exactly.

This is `constantAnnihilation_bounded_pos` from
`ConstantAnnihilationGeneral.lean`, restated for the unified interface. -/

/-! ## SoundMethod: the 2+3 abstraction

A `SoundMethod` witnesses that a dual-rail construction produces a
CRN-implementable system. This is the "method" half of the 2+3
decomposition: it is independent of which variables are selected for
dual-railing (the "strategy" half).

To add a new method M3, one only needs to construct a `SoundMethod`
instance. It then automatically composes with all existing strategies. -/

/-- A **sound annihilation method** provides an all-at-once dual-rail
construction together with a proof that every variable in the resulting
2n-dimensional system is CRN-implementable (well-formed).

The well-formedness proof is the method's sole obligation. It is
independent of which variables "needed" to be dual-railed — the method
handles them all uniformly. The strategy determines which variables to
target; the composition theorem shows their contributions combine. -/
