  Ripple.DualRail.Incremental — Incremental (one-at-a-time) dual-railing
  (Strategy S3).

  The incremental strategy processes ill-formed variables one at a time:
    1. Pick an ill-formed variable x_i
    2. Dual-rail x_i using the chosen annihilation method (M1 or M2)
    3. Recompute ill-formed set (dual-railing x_i may have infected
       other variables via the substitution x_i → u_i − v_i)
    4. Repeat until no ill-formed variables remain

  This is the "natural" approach when one doesn't have the global picture
  of the infection graph — it was Xiang Huang's original method before
  the selective algorithm was developed [UCNC25].

  Key observations:
  - **Termination**: guaranteed in ≤ d steps (each step dual-rails one
    variable, and we never re-process a variable already dual-railed).
  - **Order-dependence**: different choices at step 1 may lead to
    different final dual-rail sets.
  - **Optimal order**: processing from bottom SCCs upward (leaves of the
    SCC condensation first) produces the minimal dual-rail set, matching
    Strategy S2.
  - **Worst case**: arbitrary order may dual-rail more variables than
    necessary, with the extreme case matching Strategy S1 (all-at-once).

  The incremental strategy is parameterized by `AnnihilationMethod`
  (M1 or M2), giving two of the six combinations.

  Historical note: the original experiments used M1 (polynomial-scale),
  which made the system "blow up" because each dual-rail step introduced
  Z = P⁺ + P⁻ terms coupling all existing dual-railed variables. With
  M2 (constant-rate), the annihilation Z = k is decoupled from the
  polynomial structure, making propagation analysis much cleaner.

/-! ## Single-step dual-railing

The atomic operation: dual-rail one variable in a system.

Given a PolyPIVP on d variables and a target variable i:
  - Replace x_i by (u_i, v_i) with x_i = u_i − v_i
  - Substitute x_i → u_i − v_i in all other equations
  - Add annihilation term to the (u_i, v_i) pair
  - Result: PolyPIVP on d+1 variables -/

/-! ### Polynomial lifting and substitution helpers

These combinators implement the three polynomial operations in a single
dual-rail step:

1. **Lift** — embed `MvPolynomial (Fin n) ℚ` into `MvPolynomial (Fin (n+1)) ℚ`
   via `rename Fin.castSucc`, adding a fresh variable slot at `Fin.last n`.

2. **Substitute** — replace `X_choice` with `X_choice − X_last` in a polynomial
   over `Fin (n+1)`, modelling the introduction of the v-rail for `choice`.

3. **Annihilation** — construct the annihilation term `Z · X_choice · X_last`
   according to the chosen method (polynomial-scale or constant-rate). -/

  }

/-! ## Propagation analysis

After dual-railing x_i, some previously well-formed variables may become
ill-formed. This "infection propagation" is the reason incremental
dual-railing can require more steps than selective.

The propagation is bounded: only variables that x_i can infect (in the
sense of Definition 5) can become ill-formed. Variables guarded by
self-multiplication are immune. -/

/-! ### Coefficient lemmas for liftAndSubst

The `liftAndSubst` operation is `dualRailSubst choice ∘ liftPoly`, where:
- `liftPoly` = `rename Fin.castSucc` (maps variables injectively into `Fin (d+1)`)
- `dualRailSubst choice` = `aeval` replacing `X (castSucc choice)` with
  `X (castSucc choice) − X (Fin.last d)`, fixing all other variables.

When `j ≠ choice`, variable `castSucc j` is not touched by `dualRailSubst`,
so any factor of `X (castSucc j)` present before substitution survives.
In ring-theoretic terms: `dualRailSubst choice (X (castSucc j) * q) =
X (castSucc j) * dualRailSubst choice q`. -/

/-! #### Polynomial decomposition

We decompose `q = jPart q j + safeRest q j` where:
- `jPart q j`: monomials with `σ j ≥ 1` (divisible by `X_j`)
- `safeRest q j`: monomials with `σ j = 0`

Under well-formedness + guard conditions, `safeRest` has non-negative
coefficients and no `X_i` involvement, so `liftAndSubst` preserves
non-negativity. The `jPart` carries the `X (castSucc j)` factor through
the ring homomorphism. -/

/-- After dual-railing variable i, the set of newly ill-formed variables
is contained in {j | CanInfect p i j}. Variables guarded from i remain
well-formed.

More precisely: in the lifted polynomial `liftAndSubst i (p j)`, every
monomial with negative coefficient has exponent ≥ 1 at position
`Fin.castSucc j`, preserving the CRN-implementability form
`x_j' = prod − degr · x_j`.

Hypotheses:
- `hj_wf`: variable j is well-formed in the original system (every negative
  monomial in `p j` is divisible by `X j`).
- `hj_guard`: i cannot infect j (every positive monomial in `p j` containing
  `X i` also contains `X j`).
- `hne`: j ≠ i (we don't dual-rail j itself; this is about bystander
  variables).

The mathematical argument is that `dualRailSubst i` is a ring homomorphism
that fixes `X (castSucc j)` (since j ≠ i), so it preserves the factor
`X (castSucc j)` that guards every negative monomial. -/

/-! ## Relationship between S3 and S2

The incremental strategy stays within the infected set: dual-railing
any variable inside `infectedSet` never disturbs variables outside it.
This is why S3 and S2 agree on the selection — both target `infectedSet`.

The key one-step invariant is `incremental_preserves_outside`:
  - Variables outside R are well-formed (`wellFormed_of_not_infected`)
  - They are guarded from all infected variables (`guard_preservation`)
  - After dual-railing any infected variable, they remain well-formed
    (`propagation_bounded`) -/

/-- **Incremental stays within infectedSet.** Dual-railing a variable
`i ∈ R` preserves well-formedness of every variable `j ∉ R`.

This is the inductive step justifying why S3 discovers exactly S2's
selection: bystanders outside R are never disturbed, regardless of
processing order. Composes `propagation_bounded` with `guard_preservation`. -/

/-! ## M1 vs M2 in the incremental setting

With M1 (polynomial-scale), each dual-rail step introduces
Z_i = P̂_i⁺ + P̂_i⁻ terms that couple the new (u_i, v_i) pair to all
previously dual-railed variables. This creates cross-dependencies that
make the propagation analysis harder and the intermediate systems larger.

With M2 (constant-rate), the annihilation Z = k · u_i · v_i involves only
the pair itself. No new cross-dependencies are introduced, making the
propagation analysis local: only variables directly appearing in x_i's
equation are affected.

This is why M2 × S3 is more practical than M1 × S3, even though both
combinations are formally valid. -/

/-- The constant-rate annihilation polynomial `C k * X_u * X_v` is a single
monomial with exponent 1 at the u-rail and v-rail, 0 elsewhere. -/

/-- With constant-rate annihilation, dual-railing x_i does not introduce
new dependencies between existing species. The annihilation polynomial
`C k * X_u * X_v` only involves the pair `(u_i, v_i)`: every monomial
in its support has zero exponent at all other variables.

Contrast with polynomial-scale annihilation `X_u * X_v * (P̂⁺ + P̂⁻)`,
where `P̂⁺ + P̂⁻` can involve all variables in the system, creating
cross-dependencies between dual-railed pairs. -/
